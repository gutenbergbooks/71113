  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c009'>MR. BLACK WRITES HIS PROSPECTUS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Amidst the anxieties of making salads, the desire
to convert Heather from the evils and dangers of
English cookery, skirmishes with Mrs. Ormson,
criticisms on Bessie, and the personal enjoyment
of such luxuries as ripe fruit, coffee of her own
manufacture, chocolate and claret <i><span lang="la">ad libitum</span></i>, Miss
Hope by no means forgot Mr. Black’s commercial
scheme, and the efforts she felt confident he was
making to induce Arthur to embark in it with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A woman sharp and clever enough in her generation,
she was yet no match, either in sharpness or
cleverness, for Mr. Black. If she knew a few things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>about him, he “was up,” so he phrased it, “to two
or three of her moves,” and could turn the tables on
her, when she tried his temper, as is often the wise
fashion of her sex, a little too much.</p>

<p class='c011'>The very first morning she opened fire upon him,
the promoter informed Arthur, he “knew what the
old lady was up to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the peculiarly diplomatic manner in
which Miss Hope, finding that Heather inclined to
do nothing, commenced her operations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time was breakfast; scene, the dining-room
at Berrie Down, with all the windows open; actors,
Miss Hope and Mr. Black: interested spectators,
the family and visitors generally.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray,” began the spinster, coquetting, as she
spoke, with a peach which might have been grown
in Eden, it looked so fresh and tempting; “pray,
Mr. Black, can you tell me of a good investment for
a small sum of money?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Across the table Mr. Black looked at her, with a
merry twinkle in his eyes; then he answered,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the Three per Cents.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But my friend would not be satisfied with three
per cent.,” said Miss Hope.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“A mortgage, or some good freehold estate,
might suit her then,” suggested Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not say it was a lady, so far as I am
aware,” remarked Miss Hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; but I concluded no man would ask a lady
friend to make such inquiries for him,” explained
her antagonist. “She might get four, or even four
and a half, and still be safe enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what is four and a half?” observed Miss
Hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Four pounds ten shillings per cent. per annum,”
answered Mr. Black, at which reply Arthur laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You won’t make much of him, aunt,” he said;
“you cannot get him to advise an unsafe investment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Miss Hope turned towards her
nephew, evidently meditating an attack on him.
Changing her mind, however, she addressed herself
to Mr. Black once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there is more surely than four and a half
per cent. to be had now-a-days, is there not; in
some of those great companies, for instance?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All swindles, ma’am,” declared the promoter.
“Should not advise you, or at least your friend, to
have anything to do with them. In the companies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>that are <i><span lang="fr">bona fide</span></i>, all the shares are snapped up
before the project is well before the public. Whenever
you hear of shares going a-begging, depend
upon it the whole concern is rotten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are an authority in such matters?” she
suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a better authority than Miss Hope,” replied
Mr. Black, gallantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean; do you think I know anything
about investments?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard that either you or some friend of
yours does,” he answered. “I have heard of very
good ventures you have made,—of shares sold in the
nick of time, and bought wisely, and at a very low
figure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I assure you, Mr. Black, you have been misinformed,”
said the spinster, eagerly; “all my
money is sunk in a life annuity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which, no doubt, ma’am, you purchased on as
favourable terms as those shares in the Great
Britain and Ireland Canal Company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you <em>had</em> to do with that!” exclaimed Miss
Hope, setting down her claret-glass with most unladylike
vehemence, and looking at the promoter as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>though he were a culprit caught in the very act.
“I always thought that was one of your schemes;
but never felt sure of it till now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not wise to be too sure of anything,” Mr.
Black answered. “I had nothing, as it happened, to
do with the Great Britain and Ireland Canal Company.
If I had, perhaps you might not have lost
by your shares; but a man I know, a confoundedly
clever fellow, got rid of his the day before the
smash came, and it was he who told me you had got
your fingers burnt. Your friend, Mr. Pembroke,
did not advise you with his customary caution there,
Miss Hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Pembroke had nothing to do with the
matter,” said Miss Hope, angrily; “and how you
happen to be so well acquainted with my private
affairs is a mystery to me. I do not consider such
prying gentlemanly. I do not know what may be
thought of such conduct among business people,
Mr. Black, but in a different circle——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought it was of business we were talking,”
interrupted the promoter, “of affairs which were
strictly commercial! The moment any one goes on
the market, Miss Hope, either personally or by deputy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>that moment he or she becomes public property. I
never pretended to be a gentleman; but I do not
think I would go prying into my neighbour’s secret
concerns for all that, any more than you would do,”
he added, significantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost involuntarily Heather’s eyes sought Miss
Hope’s face at this statement, and under Mrs.
Dudley’s look the spinster turned redder even than
she had done at the conclusion of Mr. Black’s
speech.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am perfectly incapable of impertinent or undue
meddling in any person’s concerns,” she said.
“Thank God, curiosity is a feeling that I was born
without.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you ought to be sent to the South Kensington
Museum,” remarked Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you think, aunt, that is going a little too
far?” inquired Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hope only meant that she had no curiosity
about indifferent subjects,” put in Mrs. Black, as usual
making matters worse by trying to mend them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hope meant no such thing,” snapped that
lady. “I meant precisely what I said; that I have
no curiosity, and that I never had any.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Not even to see unfinished pictures and statues
in course of chiselling,” suggested Mrs. Ormson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not think Miss Hope has any undue
curiosity,” said Heather; “at least, I know she has
not nearly so much as I. It interests me to know
the name, and occupation, and worldly means, even,
of Dora Scrotter’s lover down at the mill. In
the country one learns to be inquisitive about one’s
neighbours. There is so little excitement or amusement,
that every piece of gossip is seized on eagerly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You dear Heather, as if you were a gossip!”
exclaimed Bessie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is just what I say about the country,”
remarked Mr. Black; “life stagnates here; you
should come to London, Mrs. Dudley; come and
bring the girls, and we will take you about. There
are lots of rooms in Stanley Crescent crying out for
some one to come and occupy them. Persuade your
husband to give himself a holiday whenever the
crops are in; you have never paid us a visit yet,
and I call it mean.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We should be only too delighted if you would
come,” murmured Mrs. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, all <em>I</em> can say is,” remarked Miss Hope,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“that if I had such a place as Berrie Down, I would
never leave it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not even to go abroad?” asked Mrs. Ormson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not even to go abroad,” answered Miss Hope,
deliberately—an assertion which took every one so
much by surprise, that no person disputed its truthfulness;
not even Arthur, who, feeling his aunt’s
words were intended as a useful moral lesson for
him, longed to argue the matter out with her, and
say he should go to London, or stay at Berrie Down,
or take a still longer journey if it pleased him to do
so, without consulting any one in the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would like greatly to have my nephew
staying in Stanley Crescent?” Miss Hope said to
Mrs. Black later on in the course of the same day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should <em>greatly</em>,” answered the promoter, and
thus war was declared between them; and from that
day forth Miss Hope began unintentionally playing
into her enemy’s hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take care what you are about with that man,
Arthur,” she entreated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear aunt, I am much obliged to you for
your kindness, but I believe I can manage my own
affairs,” he returned.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Heather, you must speak to Arthur,” she then
declared; “if you do not speak, you will one day
repent your weakness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I am afraid of vexing him,” Mrs. Dudley
objected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Vex, nonsense; better vex him than lose every
sixpence you have in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think my speaking likely to do any
good?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It cannot do any harm;” and thus exhorted,
Heather inquired,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you any intention, Arthur, of—of going
into business?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Business,” he repeated; “what in the world put
such an idea as that into your mind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You and Mr. Black are always talking together.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you object to our talking?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; only I love Berrie Down, Arthur.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which my aunt thinks I am in danger of
losing; is that it, Heather? No, I won’t lose Berrie
Down, nor beggar you and the children. Does that
content you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Arthur;” and she put her arm round his
neck, and kissed him; and he, in return, kissed her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>grateful, perhaps, for a wife whom so little confidence
satisfied, or at least silenced; and who was
as grateful for a kind word, for a loving look, as
many a woman for the devotion of a life.</p>

<p class='c011'>In those days, Arthur Dudley was a much more
agreeable individual than he had seemed for many
a year previously.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was gayer, brighter, kindlier. He refrained
from grumbling, and ceased to recite the benefits he
had conferred upon his family.</p>

<p class='c011'>There had come a summer to his winter, and in
the bright sunshine all the good plants that were
formerly hidden under the snows of adversity, put
forth and blossomed into flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>For such a change, could Heather be otherwise
than thankful? Did not every creature about the
house—every man, woman, and child, and even the
very dumb animals—feel happier and better because
the head of the family, believing fortune was coming
towards him, looked out over the world with different
eyes, and thought there was at last good to be found
in it?</p>

<p class='c011'>The labourers worked more willingly; the very
cattle seemed to thrive better; the dogs, forgivingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>forgetful that their master had been wont to repulse
their demonstrations of affections with an angry,
“Get off, will you!” came bounding towards
him over the meadows and across the yard.
They were so pleased with the notice he took of
them in those days, that they lost their heads and
made themselves perfectly ridiculous with their
rejoicings and gambolings. They rolled each other
over on the grass, and barked and worried each his
companion in the friendliest manner possible. When
Arthur entered the room, Muff, Lally’s dearly beloved
and much-enduring kitten, now kept her position,
instead of walking off gravely shaking her hind
legs at him as she went. He had been wont to
kick her also out of the way, but now he did not
disdain to look when Bessie held the saucer of milk
for which she had taught Muff to beg.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even Jinny, the ill-conditioned goat, came in for
her share of the universal sunshine; while as for
Heather, she basked in it. Had it not been for
Miss Hope’s eternal warnings, she would have forgotten
her anxieties; ay, even the unpromising page
of her own life which had been suddenly opened for
her inspection.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Arthur was happy; and she is but a poor wife to
whom the sight of her husband’s happiness does not
bring rejoicing also! As for Lally, a new leaf in her
book also was turned over. One day she came in to
her mother—hot, breathless, excited—exclaiming,
“Lally’s been to the mill, and Mr. Scrotter gave
her two—beau—ful bantams!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who went with you to the mill, my pet?” asked
Heather; little expecting, however, to hear Lally
say in reply,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pa tooked me; and pa says, when Lally’s a big
girl she shall have a nicer pony than Jack to ride,
and that he’ll go out with her. Pa says it!” and
Lally stood and looked at her mother as though
expecting Heather to make an immediate memorandum
of these remarkable words.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! Heaven, how the poor Squire built his castles
and furnished them in that glorious summer weather;
in what a fairy edifice he lived; through what rose-coloured
glass he surveyed his future life! How
different everything looked; how changed he felt;
how swiftly the stream of his existence flowed by!
He was galloping on to fortune, and he never
thought of the chance of fall or accident by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>way. He believed in his steed, and the idea of
stumbling or breaking down never occurred to him.
He was in for it now; he had—as Mr. Black said to
himself at the conclusion of their first actual conversation
on the subject—“tasted blood;” and till
the game was hunted down, Arthur was never likely
to look back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, there was such perpetual excitement
about the matter. Letters arrived, letters were
answered, advertisements were drawn up, a prospectus
had to be written. Post time became a
longed-for hour at Berrie Down.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something to do, something to expect;
the monotony of that country existence was broken
up. Life at the Hollow, all at once, ceased to be
mere vegetation. For himself the Squire never
could have made an object and a purpose; but here,
constantly at his right hand, was a man full of
energy and expedients—a man who had confidence
both in himself and in his project; who, pulling
away with might and main towards opulence and
success, was kind enough to take Arthur Dudley
as a passenger in the same boat, and amuse him, as
they rowed along, with descriptions of that fair land
whither they were journeying.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Many a wiser person than Arthur Dudley has
been led away by much more delusive prospects of
fortune than those concerning which Mr. Black
waxed daily more and more eloquent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, the mere fact of having anything actually
to do—“anything to get up for,” so Mr. Black put
the matter—proved an agreeable variety to the
Squire.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not yet old enough to prefer repose to
action, to dislike change, to distrust novelties; and
there can be no question but that the brisk confidence
of Mr. Black’s ideas—the sharp decision of
Mr. Black’s manner, seemed a pleasant variety to a
man who had for years and years been droning
through life, wandering over the fields with his
hands in his pockets, grumbling at his labourers,
lamenting concerning his inferior crops, and his
cattle that would not grow beef fast enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>Other trifles also conspired to gratify him at this
time; such trifles as a man must have lived very
quietly and very economically even to notice. But
then it was many a long day since Arthur had lived
otherwise than quietly and economically, and for that
reason one or two journeys taken to town about this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>period with Mr. Black—when the pair went about
London regardless of expense, rushed from one end
of town to the other in hansoms, kept cabs waiting
for them without a thought of the ultimate cost;
tipped footmen, porters, watermen; took trains from
all parts of London for all suburbs and country
districts that could be mentioned; treated subordinates
to wonderful luncheons, or else had them up
for dinner to Stanley Crescent, and went with them
afterwards to the play—made a curious impression
on the mind of a man who had hitherto looked conscientiously
at a sovereign before spending it; who
had almost ever since he left college travelled
second-class, affected omnibuses, shunned staying in
great houses on account of needful gratuities, and
generally pinched himself as much as an honest
gentleman, left but with a small property and many
incumbrances, was likely to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, this recital of scraping, careful, unexciting
poverty must prove as wearisome and unendurable
in a book as the reality does, when your
neighbour (a person to be shunned) says he has to
count his sixpences carefully and walk to the station
for the sake of his family. The least said is soonest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>mended in such cases, no doubt; and the terrible
economics poor Squire Dudley had been guilty of are
now reluctantly named only to render intelligible
the reason why rattling about London, in company
with Mr. Black, seemed to him pleasant by contrast.</p>

<p class='c011'>To be sure—and this is really the singular part of
the business—what was spent came out of Arthur’s
pocket. Various heads of cattle speedily followed
Nellie, and the money they yielded was distributed
by Mr. Black with no niggardly hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew the means by which to float a company;
he believed that the way to every man’s heart was
through the palm of his right hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mesmerism, he said, was a round-about way of
putting yourself <i><span lang="fr">en rapport</span></i> with any one, in comparison
to slipping a sovereign between his fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, to get up other people’s steam, it is
necessary, first, to raise your own; and Mr. Black
held, and held truly, that there is no easier way of
doing this than to rush from office to office, from
station to bank, from bank to private house, all at
express speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is how we live,” he was wont to say to
Arthur Dudley; and, on the whole, the Squire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>thought such a way of living far from disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c011'>They did not ask or want money from anyone, I
pray you recollect. The great ship was still on the
stocks; there had not occurred a single hitch in the
business; it was all fair weather work, so far, at
least, as Arthur could see; all like ordering goods
and writing cheques; giving employment and paying
cash; and it never occurred to the Squire that there
could be another side to the picture; that sometimes
business assumed the form of selling goods, and
asking for payment. He was but a novice, and
believed implicitly their ship would glide smoothly
into the water; that she would carry a good cargo;
that the profits on her freight would be enormous;
that the passengers would all have a fair voyage,
and agree well by the way; that there would be
plenty, and to spare, for everybody; and that he
should never have any harder work to do than
running up to town with Mr. Black, and holding
interviews with all sorts and conditions of men.</p>

<p class='c011'>They saw printers and got estimates; they ticked
off the best advertising media in “Mitchell’s
Newspaper Guide;” they looked at offices in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>City, they had long and confidential discourses with
auctioneers and house-agents; they drove to Stangate
and went over the mills, which were in full
work, and in and out of which went and came men
covered with flour, and of a generally white and
dusty appearance; they dined at Wandsworth with
Mr. Bailey Crossenham, and at Sydenham with Mr.
Robert Crossenham.</p>

<p class='c011'>They netted their thousands and their tens of
thousands easily enough, after the ladies left the
room, over wine which could not have been better.
Capital, the Messrs. Crossenham agreed, was all
that any business needed to ensure success. They
made fortunes by the aid of pen and ink. Hundreds
of tons of wheat—millions upon millions
of loaves; the merest gains, the slightest margin of
profit, swelled up to something almost incredible per
annum. The Messrs. Crossenham were in the
highest spirits about the new undertaking; but then
certainly one fact concerning those worthy brothers
must be borne in mind, namely, that they had been
tottering on the very verge of bankruptcy when Mr.
Black rushed to the rescue. This, which of course
remained a secret amongst the trio, accounted for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>much that even in those early days puzzled Arthur
Dudley—as, for instance, the intense respect wherewith
these apparently well-to-do men treated Mr.
Peter Black; the deference they paid to his opinions;
the readiness with which they fell into all his views;
the rapidity with which they seized and acted on his
suggestions. There was not that independence of
manner about the brothers which Arthur considered
their means and position might have warranted them
in assuming; but the conclusion he drew from all
this was that, clever as he thought Mr. Black to be,
people who ought to know much more about the
promoter than it was possible for him to do, thought
him cleverer still; and, had anything been wanting
to increase Squire Dudley’s confidence in his
leader, the manner in which that individual was
treated by those with whom they came into actual
contact, must have raised Mr. Black considerably in
his kinsman’s esteem.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the men amongst whom they mixed freely,
the promoter, in fact, stood precisely in the same
enviable position as that dog who has got a good
bone, down to other curs.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a certain envious deference they followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>him, hoping to get a portion of the spoil, or the
reversion, perhaps, of the bone itself, should Mr.
Black by any accident drop it; whilst as for
Arthur, the promoter had told and hinted such
falsehoods concerning his position, his wealth, his
tremendous pluck, his untiring energy, his determination
to make the “Protector” a success, that the
Squire was welcomed in the City with open arms,
and became all of a sudden a person of consequence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord Kemms walks in and out of his house just
as I might do in and out of yours,” remarked Mr.
Black, with calm impertinence, to a man who,
though worth a hundred thousand pounds, and the
owner of a fine place twenty miles from town, had
utterly failed in all his attempts to get grander
people to dine with him than Miller, a tallow-chandler,
who dropped his Hs, and then following
the universal law of compensation picked them up,
and stuck them in where they had no business to
make their appearance; who was for ever inverting
his personal pronouns, and vexing the soul of the
rich man’s daughter with reminiscences which,
though possibly faithful, were by no means pleasant
to hear related in the presence of a limp young
curate the lady hoped to fascinate.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>It would have amazed Arthur to know that any
human being held him in high esteem, because a
lord was, truly or untruly, reported to be running
loose about his house; and it might have annoyed
him still more to know that the cool insolence of Mr.
Black’s words brought the man who was worth a
“plum” on to the direction, where certainly no
politeness or entreaty on the part of the promoter
could have compassed such an end.</p>

<p class='c011'>Behind the scenes Squire Dudley was never, however,
permitted to peep. He saw the play go on,
and was fascinated by its variety, its excitement, its
rapid dialogue, its sunshiny hopefulness. How it
was really got up, he had not a suspicion. That it
was all tinsel and paint, and hollowness and sham,
he had not a ghost of an idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>It made a good show, and promised fair to draw
a full house. Was not that the only thing which
concerned him? Mr. Black was of this opinion, at
any rate, and took very good care he should see none
of the dirty work in course of execution. The unpleasantnesses
and difficulties, present and to come,
were all kept studiously out of view. The king was
never beheld without crown and sceptre; if the queen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>ate bread and honey, it was partaken of with locked
doors, and in a decorous privacy.</p>

<p class='c011'>No fairy met Arthur’s view destitute of gauze;
unadorned with spangles, rouge, and pearl powder.
The back of the canvas had no existence for him.
If disagreeable letters arrived, Mr. Black did not
show them to his coadjutor, but stated generally
these private epistles concerned his other ventures.
If a man’s consent were doubtful, the promoter saw
him first alone. On insecure ground he knew
better than to let Arthur step; and if the Squire
returned to his country home, thinking the new
company had hitherto not met with a check, who
can feel surprised?</p>

<p class='c011'>Whenever there was the faintest chance of a gale,
his clever captain got him into the cabin, and kept
him there till the storm had blown by, or the danger
was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw the life and the fun of the voyage, but
none of the peril; and so he went back to Berrie
Down brighter and more cheerful than ever, and
Heather seeing him happy could not brace up her
courage for the explanation Miss Hope assured her
was essential, if she would save herself and the
children from beggary.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Perhaps the part of the business which Arthur
enjoyed most was that of assisting to write the
prospectus.</p>

<p class='c011'>On that document, Mr. Black asserted, hung the
fate of the “Protector Bread and Flour Company,
Limited,” and the mutual talents of Arthur Dudley
and Peter Black, Esquires, were employed for one
entire fortnight in writing, correcting, and revising
the production which ultimately went forth to the
world, like many another great and good work,
anonymously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may seem an easy thing to write a prospectus,”
remarked Mr. Black. “The fellows that do histories,
and novels, and newspaper articles, I dare say
imagine there can be no trouble about drawing up
an attractive advertisement; but let one of them try
to do it—that is all I say. Why, a prospectus
combines within itself every literary difficulty you
could mention: it has to be got up to suit the tastes
of all readers; it must contain something to tickle
the palate of each man and woman who looks at it.
Who is to check history, and say whether it is right
or wrong? but any fool can check statistics. I had
a hack once, who used to do some of this kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>work for me, and he said it was all very fine for
Macaulay and Alison, who could write just what
they liked, and were not compelled to stick to facts,
which are such stubborn things there is sometimes
no dressing them up attractively or even decently;
but he declared there was a heap of dry bones flung
to us, and we have to compose out of those promising
materials brilliant pictures, exciting romances, perfect
blue-hooks full of sound statistical information.
And what he said was true. Our style must be at
once brief and persuasive. We must be eloquent in
order to draw shareholders, and yet mindful that
each word costs money. We must say nothing we
are not prepared to verify. We must be as well up
in grammar as in the price of shares. We must not
slander our neighbour, nor unduly exalt ourselves; and
yet we are bound to show that, since the beginning
of time, the heart of man never imagined, and the
brain of man never conceived, such a project as that
which we have the honour of submitting to the
consideration of the intelligent and discriminating
British public.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You should write a pamphlet on the subject,”
suggested Arthur, laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“I wish I could—I wish I dare. It would be a
comfort and a satisfaction to me to tell that same
enlightened British public what I think of its sense.
Upon my honour, Dudley, the worse your company
is, the easier it is to write a prospectus about it. If
you only want to float a thing, not to carry it
through, why, you can say whatever you please
about the matter, and the more you say the better
the shares sell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why do you not put down whatever you
please about the ‘Protector’?” asked his companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just because it is <i><span lang="fr">bona fide</span></i>—because I must
stick to facts and figures—figures that will satisfy
not country simpletons, and ambitious widows, and
discontented governesses, but sound commercial
men. It is a serious matter, my friend, and must
be wisely concocted and wisely executed. That is
why I put in merely a preliminary advertisement
hitherto. I knew the <i><span lang="fr">grand coup</span></i> would require both
time and thought. We must have a little of the
moral, the philanthropic, the hygienic, the scientific,
the statistical, and the profitable; and we ought to
put a Latin quotation at the top: it will look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>classical, and complimentary to the attainments of
the people to whom it is addressed. Greek might
be better, or Hebrew; but I suppose you do not
understand Hebrew?”</p>

<p class='c011'>To which accusation Arthur pleading guilty, Mr.
Black urged upon him the immediate necessity of
“rubbing up” his Latin, and finding an appropriate
heading for the prospectus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall want one to go round the stamp also,”
proceeded the promoter; “but that is not immediately
required. Yes, it is, though,” he added, “for
I must mention the stamp at the end of the prospectus.
Now, Dudley, look alive; if I do the
composing, the compiling, and the inventing, surely
I may depend on you for the Latin and correct
English!”</p>

<p class='c011'>After fourteen years, the Squire’s classical education
had the dust thus brushed off it, in order to
furnish a plausible swindler with a couple of Latin
mottoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>For twice seven years he had kept this thing by
him, that it might serve Mr. Black’s turn at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dudley’s!” said that individual, in frank explanation
to his City friends. “Devilish neat and taking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>ain’t it? Bring in the parsons; they’ll think the
whole thing has been drawn up by some Oxford man,
as the Latin was, for that matter, out of a well
which has not had any water pumped from it for
Heaven knows how long. If you have any suggestion
to make on the subject make it, or else hereafter hold
your tongues, for I am going to have the prospectus
printed off to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could not be better!” answered his friends in
chorus; and the programme of the “Protector
Bread and Flour Company, Limited,” was accordingly
sent down to Harp Lane, where it was printed
(on credit) by a protégé of Mr. Black’s, on a very
superior satin paper, procured on credit likewise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next day after delivery, proof was duly forwarded,
and the day afterwards the prospectus was returned—pressed,
folded, multiplied a thousand-fold—to
Peter Black, Esq., at the Temporary Offices of the
Company, 220, Dowgate Hill. The bundle, containing
programmes of the “Protector Bread and
Flour Company, Limited,” was flung down on the
counter in the outer office of 220, Dowgate Hill, at
five to five precisely, and, at three minutes to six,
four hundred and twenty-five prospectuses were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>wrapped up, directed, stamped, and posted at the
chief office, Lombard Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s off the stocks at last, thank God!” said
Mr. Black to Squire Dudley, who stood beside him;
“she’s off the stocks and afloat!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>It was late on in the autumn by this time, and most
of the visitors who had come down to the Hollow in
the bright summer weather were now elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hope, having patched up a peace with her
nephew, was at Copt Hall; Mrs. Ormson at Torquay,
with her eldest son, the state of whose health was
considered unsatisfactory; Mrs. Black, at Hastings;
Mr. Black, much in town; Mr. Harcourt, in Scotland;
and Bessie, at home, keeping house for her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no one left at Berrie Down, in fact, excepting
Master Marsden, who remained on at the
Hollow, because the state of Dr. Marsden’s finances
prevented the boy being sent to school; while the
state of his mother’s health rendered it an act of
real charity to keep the “noisy, ill-mannered, ill-conditioned
young whelp” (this was Arthur’s summary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of him) away from that small, uncomfortable,
wretchedly-managed suburban house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early in November, Alick was to enter on his
new duties; and at Christmas, by special desire of
Arthur, there was to be another and, larger family
gathering in Berrie Down. All kinds of people
were to meet all other kinds of people; and the
Hollow, he said, “should see Christmas kept in
thorough good old English style, for once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Already the younger Dudleys were speculating
as to whether there would be an abundance of berries
on the holly bushes, and Mrs. Piggott was looking
to the fattening of her turkeys, and meditatively
calculating how many of those unfortunate birds the
expected guests would, in all probability, consume.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already she was pouring into the ears of her
youthful handmaiden, Prissy Dobbin by name, tales
which sounded to that unsophisticated damsel like
romances, anent the number of plums she should
have to stone, currants to wash and dry and pick,
about the quantity of mixed peel she must cut up,
and the amount of suet she would have to chop, for
the Christmas puddings. As for mincemeat, Mrs.
Piggott avowed her intention of commencing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>whenever the twenty-first of November was come
and past; and had the Israelites been journeying,
for a second time, out of Egypt, and purposed
making a halt at Berrie Down on their way, the
worthy housekeeper could scarcely have “salted
down” a larger quantity of butter, nor looked more
anxiously at the tenants of the poultry-yard and the
contents of the nests than she did.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for herbs—Miss Priscilla Dobbin’s private
opinion was, that “the deuce was in Mrs. Piggott
about them.” For ever, so she told her mother,
she was rubbing off those herbs into bottles, and
tying them down; while, in respect of pickles, it is
on record, the assistant made herself so frightfully
ill with devouring those exhilarating articles of diet
wholesale, that the cook assured her she should be
sent home forthwith if she could not content herself
for the future with cooler viands than chilies and
chutnee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drat them girls!” exclaimed Mrs. Piggott;
“they’re every one alike now—for crinolines, and
vinegar, and piccalilly. I remember a young housemaid
as used to come and see me when I was taking
care of General Furdie’s house in Gloucester Place—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>believe she used to live on pickles—bought
them at the oilman’s, sixpenny-worth at a time, and
if she came and sat with me for half an hour, she
would finish the lot while she sat talking. Ah!
girls ain’t like what they used to be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And a good job too that they bain’t,” retorted
Priscilla, who was certainly as unlike one of Mrs.
Piggott’s ideal maidens as can well be conceived.</p>

<p class='c011'>Except that she could “get through her work,”
when she chose to devote herself to it, and that
she was sufficiently “owdacious and comical” to
make time pass fast in the Berrie Down kitchen,
Priscilla Dobbin was not possessed, in Mrs. Piggott’s
eyes, of a solitary virtue.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was not “one” the cook would ever have
had about the house; but, of course, Mrs. Dudley
knew best—a severely ironical expression, which
meant that Mrs. Dudley knew nothing whatever
about the matter; indeed, Mrs. Piggott had been
heard to say, that “a baby in arms was as fit to
choose a servant as her mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After all, however, Priscilla was not exactly an
importation of Mrs. Dudley’s. A girl had been
wanted, and this girl, a protégée of Bessie’s, stepped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>at once from a wretched home to service at Berrie
Down, where she worked harder, and idled more
persistently, than any young person “of her inches,”
that it had ever been Mrs. Piggott’s misfortune previously
to come into contact with.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet with all she was as good company, in
her rank, as Bessie Ormson in a higher; better,
perhaps, for she possessed artistic, histrionic, and
imitative powers, of which the young lady was
utterly destitute.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Dobbin had been taught at school to curtsey,
or “bob,” as she called it; but elsewhere she had
learned to dance with anybody, and to execute
“steps” which were the delight and envy of the
kitchen at Berrie Down. At school she had been
taught psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; but
out of hours she had acquired a stock of ballads that
would have horrified the propriety of the vicar of
North Kemms, Priscilla’s native parish, had he been
privileged to hear them. At school she was taught
to read, write, cipher, and do sampler work; out of
school it had ever been her pleasure and delight to
mimic the peculiarities of mistress and master, of
clergyman and clergyman’s wife, of the ladies who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>visited the school, and of her fellow-companions,
playmates, father, mother, and society generally.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was but a young thing when she came to the
Hollow, sixteen or thereabouts, with a scanty supply
of clothes, a crinoline which was at once the plague
and delight of her life, a net to contain her hair, and
induce people to believe it was long like a grownup
woman’s, and a stock of impudence that was,
were Mrs. Piggott’s testimony on the subject reliable,
“more than enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With Priscilla it was not, however, perhaps, that
she had so much impudence as that she had so little
reverence; and for this reason, spite of Mrs. Piggott’s
high social position, her imposing cap, her stately
manner, and her reminiscences of the good old times,
the young girl treated her with as little ceremony
as she might one of her playmates, and “answered
the housekeeper back,”—an indignity which had
never previously been inflicted on that individual by
anyone, gentle or simple.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She had always lived with people above and
below, as knew their places and kept to them, till
‘you came,’” she stated to Miss Dobbin; whereupon
Miss Dobbin inquired—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“O Lor’, there, ain’t you glad I am come, that
you may see some new life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Did Mrs. Piggott threaten to report Prissy to
Mrs. Dudley, that young person entreated of her
to make haste and do so, “before her shoes wore
out.” Did the housekeeper, talking at Priscilla,
endeavour to point a moral and adorn a tale by
stating what was done in her young days—and what
her first mistress, the lady of Mr. Serjeant Hickley,
counsellor to the King (so Mrs. Piggott understood
K.C.), said when she saw a servant with a bow or
a bonnet, let alone a flower, added Mrs. Piggott
parenthetically—Priscilla, rich in ribbons, flowers,
and laces, flung to her from Miss Ormson’s stores,
thanked her stars “she had not lived in them days,
and thought it was quite time the good old times were
gone and past, if anybody was to have any comfort
of their lives.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sure I’m glad I warn’t born then, Mrs.
Piggott; for one thing I’d be as old as you, and
have nothing before me; I’d have lived it all, and
not have a thing to look forward to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better have nothing to look forward to than some
things to look back upon,” answered Mrs. Piggott,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>sententiously; which immediately elicited from Miss
Dobbin the inquiry whether she had got that out of
her own head or somebody else’s, and if these were
some things she did not care to look back upon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Clearly, the housekeeper said the girl could come
to no good, and yet in her heart Mrs. Piggott liked
this feminine ne’er-do-weel, and would have felt the
house lonely without her.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the whole, she preferred Prissy’s chatter to
the more staid and sensible discourse of Jane, the
housemaid, or Sarah, her assistant in dairy and
kitchen. Though torture could not have wrung
such a confession from her, Mrs. Piggott dearly
loved gossip; and, if she had searched the home
counties through, she could not have discovered a
more industrious collector and retailer of news than
Priscilla Dobbin.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the colour of the moire antique the vicar’s
wife wore when she went to dine at Moorlands, to
the name of Miss Amy Raidsford’s “intended,”
Priscilla had every atom of parish information at
her fingers’ ends. Why the lady’s-maid was dismissed
from Moorlands—what Lord Kemms said
when he found his gardener sending all the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>fruit to Covent Garden, and only retaining windfalls
for dessert at the Park—Prissy knew as well as
though she had been present.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was it only from the neighbourhood of North
Kemms that Miss Dobbin collected materials for conversation.
She knew all about the low marriage Mr.
Harry Camperdon, the Fifield rector’s son, had contracted
with the sexton’s daughter from Palinsbridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I wouldn’t ha’ married her if she had been
hung with diamonds—should always ha’ felt or
thought she had been dug up out of the graves.
Seen her?—to be sure I have, Mrs. Piggott—as thin
as a hurdle, and as pale and sickly-looking as a bit
of your underdone crust. She’s a contrast to Mrs.
Raidsford. You don’t mean to say you have never
had a sight of Mrs. Raidsford! then you have a treat
to come; like the side of a house, and mean! would
look after the candles’ ends, if her husband let her,
and grudges throwing away her nail-parings. There
is not a servant in the house dare give a glass of
beer unbeknown, and they all say a nicer gentleman
nobody need wish to serve. It is thought Lord
Kemms would make up to one of the daughters, if
it wasn’t for her; but he can’t abide her. Well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>if I was Lord Kemms, I know who I’d have—money
or no money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so on, <i><span lang="la">ad libitum</span></i>, the whole day long. Making
beds, cleaning plates, shelling peas, stirring preserves,
Priscilla Dobbin’s tongue never ceased; and
let the burden of her song be what it would, the
refrain never varied, and that refrain was to the
effect, that, since time began, there never had been
before, and never would be again, such a young
lady as Bessie Ormson. Bessie had made her acquaintance
at a period of (to Miss Dobbin) infinite
trouble. Having been despatched to the mill to
purchase some flour, she contrived by the way to
lose the money entrusted to her. Feeling it useless
to proceed, and being afraid to return home, she
did the only thing which seems natural to boys and
girls under such circumstances, namely, lifted up
her voice and wept.</p>

<p class='c011'>While she sat on the stile leading away towards
North Kemms, with her bonnet tilted over her face,
her knuckles in her eyes, and making a display of
feet encased in strong leather boots, and a pair of
sturdy legs, which only the extremest distress could
excuse being exhibited to public view, Bessie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>coming along the field path, paused to inquire into
the cause of such despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>A greater contrast than that presented by the
pair could scarcely have been imagined. Hot and
weary with running about searching after the lost
money, sick and tired with crying, and the fear of
the “hiding,” which she explained to Bessie was
sure to follow on confession; her cheeks wet with
tears, and her face generally smeared by reason of
having been rubbed over with her dirty hands,
Priscilla’s personal appearance alone entitled her to
the profoundest commiseration.</p>

<p class='c011'>Attired, on the other hand, in the coolest of muslin
dresses, with the most coquettish of hats for head-gear,
with a lace shawl thrown carelessly round her,
holding a parasol, edged with deep fringe, a little on
one side, more apparently to protect the trimming
of her hat than her bright, fresh, beautiful face from
the rays of the sun, Bessie, leaning against the
stile, held converse with Miss Dobbin concerning
the loss she had experienced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a whole harf a crown, Miss,” said the girl,
amid a perfect gust of sobs, “and I put it in my
pocket, and I never left the path the whole way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>except to pull a branch of roses (the poor things
were lying withered and miserable, sodden and
faded in her lap), and I suppose it was when I
reached up to get them the money jumped out; but
I have looked and looked, and I can’t see it. No,
no more nor if it had had legs and run away. See,
it was over in the corner of that far held. I’ll show
you, if you like,” she added, with a faint hope,
perhaps, that Bessie might be able to find where she
had searched in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The scene of such a catastrophe has not the
slightest interest for me,” answered Bessie. “I will
take your word that the half-crown is lost, and I will
give you another in its place, or at least two shillings
and sixpence, which comes to much the same thing.
You go, or have gone, to school, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you know what a moral means?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think so, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, the moral of this afternoon’s work is:
For the future, when your mother sends you out for
flour, don’t stop to gather roses by the way, for it is
extremely unlikely that you will a second time meet
any one in these fields worth half-a-crown.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Having finished which speech, Bessie, toying with
her dainty parasol, still stood looking at the girl, for
whom she felt that compassion, which always moved
her when she saw anything of the feminine gender
unkempt, forlorn, untidy, unhopeful, uglier than she
had “a right to be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To her, an ill-dressed girl or woman was precisely
what a daub is to an artist, a series of discords to
a musician. She loved prettiness. Let a woman’s
dress be of cotton or of velvet, she still loved to see
that dress worn with a certain consciousness; and
the terrible want of self-assertion, the utter abandonment
of all self-appreciation in the girl who now
stood opposite to her, was so distressing to Bessie,
that she entreated of her as a parting favour to wash
her face, and push her hair out of her eyes before
she proceeded to the mill.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is plenty of water in the stream,” Bessie
added; “and do make use of it freely, for at present
you look as if you had been buried without a coffin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A week after, the young lady, who had forgotten
all about this occurrence, was told that a girl wanted
to speak to her—a girl from North Kemms—Priscilla
Dobbin by name.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“She does not want another half-crown, I hope,”
laughed Bessie, when she heard the name; and she
went out into the hall, looking, as she always did,
pretty enough to drive any man to distraction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Priscilla, you have not lost your money
again, have you?” thus Bessie commenced the conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Miss—I found it. I could not rest; and so,
the first afternoon mother could spare me, I had a
good look, and I took one of my little brothers, and
he got it in among a lot of weeds growing in the
ditch; and here it is back again, please, Miss—and—my
duty to you,” finished Prissy, who evidently
considered the last four words an appropriate ending
to her sentence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bessie took the half-crown, and held it in the
palm of her hand for a moment, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coin had evidently been washed, as had also
Miss Dobbins face, which was painfully red and
shiny. Then she looked at the thick clump boots,
laced up with a leathern thong—at the sturdy legs,
showing below the short, scanty, hailstorm-pattern
cotton gown—at the little old-fashioned black pelerine—at
the coarse school bonnet—at the light brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>hair, cut so short all round—at the greenish-grey
eyes, sparkling with pleasure—at the unmanageable
mouth, which would smile and break into grins of
delight at the recovery of so great a treasure—at
the hard hands, that seemed to have done so much
work—before she said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit down for a moment, I shall be back presently.”
She wanted to tell the story to Heather, and ask
her advice; but, as Heather happened to be out of
the way, Bessie returned to the hall discomforted.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not like to give the girl back the money,
or its equivalent, and she was racking her brains
what to offer, when Lally appeared on the scene of
action, with a huge wedge of cake in her hand,
which it is only right to state she was absolutely
unable to eat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lally, come here,” exclaimed Bessie. “I wish
to give this little girl something by which to remember
me—something to remind her of having been
very careless and very good. What do you think
she would like best?” and Bessie took the child in
her arms and waited, hoping, perhaps, the stranger
might suggest some desirable memento for herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Prissy never spoke, nor, for some time, did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Lally, who first stared at Priscilla from head to foot,
and then gravely turned and looked at Bessie,
wondering apparently whether that young lady could
conveniently part with her face as an appropriate
offering to the stranger. Then her eyes wandered
to Bessie’s throat, and so fell on a tiny brooch which
fastened her collar. The moment they did so—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dive her ’at,” said Lally, unhesitatingly, a suggestion
which she would have made all the same had
the trinket been worth a hundred guineas; as it was,
Bessie abode by her decision, and taking out the
brooch, handed it to Priscilla, remarking at the same
time that, “although she might not care for it then,
she would perhaps when she grew up to be a woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Not to be outdone in generosity, Lally at once
presented the girl with her piece of cake, assuring
her it was “very dood,” the truth of which statement
Bessie doubted exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next day, over came Mrs. Dobbin to know
whether it was “correct as a young lady at Berrie
Down had given her gal a golden brooch? She did
not think her gal would tell a lie, but still young
uns wanted to be looked arter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Assured of the rectitude of the transaction, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Dobbin, after having been refreshed with ale and a
slice of bread and meat, was permitted to depart.
“Altogether, the half-crown threatens to prove a
costly matter,” Bessie remarked; but Heather only
said they seemed to be very honest, worthy people,
and the subject dropped.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when, a little later on in the summer, Mrs.
Dudley perceived it would be necessary to procure
some young person to assist in the housework, Bessie
proposed that a trial should be given to Priscilla;
and never ceased her entreaties for the girl to be
engaged until Heather said Bessie and the girls
might walk over to North Kemms and talk to Mrs.
Dobbin about the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing loath was Mrs. Dobbin for Priscilla to
“go out,” “except,” she said, “that in the matter of
clothes she feared Prissy warn’t fit to be seen in a
gentleman’s house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let her come over to me, and we will arrange
that,” Miss Ormson answered; and accordingly,
when Prissy came, out of her own wardrobe the
young lady furnished that of the new servant—telling
her at the same time, laughingly, she was
“made up for life.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“And you may think yourself a lucky gal,” remarked
the mother on the first Sunday when Priscilla
went home, about a month after her entrance on her
duties at Berrie Down—“having plenty of victuals,
and good clothes to your back, and a kind mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>John Dobbin was sitting in the porch during this
colloquy, looking askance at his daughter’s finery
the while. When she came to exhibit her new dress
to him, he observed, first, that “fine feathers didn’t
make fine birds,” and then inquired—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who was that chap I saw thee talking to last
evening, this side Moorlands?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I warn’t out yesterday evening, father,” answered
the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Warn’t thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou mayn’t have told a lie about that half-a-crown
piece, but I doubt thou’rt telling a lie now,
my lass,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you can ask Mrs. Dudley if I went out
yesterday,” retorted Prissy, defiantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I take it Madam Dudley has something else to
do than watch the coming and going of a wench
like thou,” he answered; “mayhap she don’t know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the one-half of what anybody in the house does;
but I can tell thee this much, Prissy—that if I
catches thee going wrong, I’ll break every bone in
thy body, if it was covered an inch thick with silks
and satins.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I warn’t out,” persisted Prissy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See that thou bain’t then,” returned her uncompromising
parent; and as the weeks and the months
passed by without John having any further occasion
to find fault with his first-born, it may reasonably be
presumed that she heeded his admonition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, in a general way, she gave satisfaction at
the Hollow, where she was on good terms with every
one, unless, indeed, it might be Master Marsden, who
was, as she took various opportunities of informing
him, an “ill-behaved limb,” and no “young gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last occasion on which Priscilla found herself
moved to this confession of faith, was when she
boxed Master Marsden’s ears for holding Muff, and
instructing Leonard to rub turpentine over her
coat, preliminary—so she ascertained from Lally,
who came rushing to her in an agony of distress—to
“making a bonfire of my poor tittens.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>That Master Marsden never forgave this interference
with his legitimate pleasures, and that his
wrath was very grievously moved, both at Lally’s
tale-bearing and Prissy’s prompt interference, may
be gathered from the fact that he informed Lally
she was a “nasty little tell-tale tit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lally not,” lamented the child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you are—and ‘your tongue shall be slit,
and every little puppy-dog shall get a little bit,’”
persisted Master Marsden, with his own tongue
very far out; adding, to Priscilla, by way of appendix
to this poem—</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for you, you ugly, snub-nosed, green-eyed
little——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No names, Harry,” interposed Alick, who
chanced to come up at the instant; “and what have
you been doing with the cat? What’s all this, I
ask?” and he looked angrily round the group.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was only going to singe her hair; it is too
long, like some people’s tongues,” answered the boy,
impudently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now look here, Harry,” said Alick; “I won’t
take you to Arthur, because he would not lay a
finger on you; but I’m your brother, and I’ll give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>you a thrashing for this you’ll perhaps remember.
Teaching Leonard such tricks, too, you cruel little
cur!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cur yourself!” retorted Harry; and in a moment
he was grappling with Alick, trying to wrest the
riding-whip he held out of his hand—kicking,
plunging, biting even; and all the time Alick
kept shaking and striking him,—Lally crying bitterly
the while—till, panting and frightened, the
boy shrieked out for mercy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the elder loosed his grasp and bade him go,
saying, “Though you make such a noise I know you
are not much hurt, but never let me catch you playing
such tricks again, or I will hurt you next time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll be even with you all yet,” observed Harry,
gratefully, as he skulked away; and this threat,
which probably had not the slightest meaning attached
to it in the boy’s mind, was remembered to
his disadvantage subsequently.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the day came that it was remembered, no
one believed his declaration of not having “meant
anything”—of not having intended to do anybody
any harm. When every creature in the house treated
him like a pariah, and avoided him as though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>had leprosy, Harry felt that he could better have
endured a dozen worse thrashings than such social
ostracism. When his assertions were received with
silent incredulity—when his questions were answered
reluctantly and with withering disdain and dislike—when
his food was handed to him as if he were some
unclean animal, unfit to eat or associate with civilized
beings—when there was a great silence in the house—when
people went about on tiptoe, and, if they
met the boy, passed him either with averted heads
or with looks of reproach and anger—when Leonard
turned king’s evidence and bore testimony against
him—when he sat in his own room, or else wandered
about the farm, kicking twigs and stones listlessly
before him—Harry felt it was all more than he
could bear, and, turning at last on Cuthbert, told
that youth he did not see why they were all so hard
upon him. “You were not a bit better, any one of
you, when you were young,” he finished, passionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>We</em> did not try to kill people,” answered his step-brother,
with dignity, as he retreated from the room,
followed by Harry’s indignant remonstrance of—</p>

<p class='c011'>“No more didn’t I—no more didn’t I!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late in the autumn, as I have said; the leaves
were falling rapidly, and, but for the constant
sweeping and supervision of “the boys,” the walks
and lawns at Berrie Down would have been littered
with the decaying foliage.</p>

<p class='c011'>As it was, barrowful after barrowful of dead leaves
disappeared from the grass in front of the drawing-room
windows, and often as not Lally sat on the top
of the load which Alick or Cuthbert wheeled away
to a corner of the kitchen-garden, and there deposited
in a great heap to make leaf-mould for the
next year’s geraniums.</p>

<p class='c011'>No more pride than Lally had these young
Dudleys. If work were not to them prayer, it was,
at all events, pleasure. It would have been a weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>life to those lads, lounging about the Hollow, taking
purposeless walks, rising in the morning to do
nothing, going to bed at night after having performed
no task, executed no duty; but, as matters
stood, each season brought its labours with it to
them. They loved the place, and they loved
Heather, and they loved work.</p>

<p class='c011'>What need is there to say more? because of all
these reasons, Berrie Down looked the Berrie Down
we have visited.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a change was coming, and Heather knew it—knew
Alick was going away, that her best helper
was about to be taken from her. Many a talk had
the pair held together over the inevitable parting;
many a word had they exchanged in the twilight,
under the shadow of those dear old trees; and, if
Alick thought Bessie’s words and talk had been
more sad and more attractive, still he knew
Heather’s discourse was the best, and so listened to
it attentively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have been my very right hand, Alick,” she
repeated over and over again; “and I do not know
what I shall do without you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor I without you, mother,” he answered, sadly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“And you are going all alone, my boy, to a
place which every one says is very, very wicked. I do
not know much about wickedness myself, Alick,” she
added, with that sweet simplicity that made her
seem so inexpressibly innocent to people who <em>did</em>
know much about that wicked world, which was a
<i><span lang="la">terra incognita</span></i> to Heather Dudley; “but I hope,
dear, that a person may be as good in London as in
the country; that you will not be led away, nor fall
into expensive habits, nor associate with undesirable
people, if only for my sake, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You darling mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If ever anyone asks you to do what is wrong, it
you are ever tempted to extravagance, to folly, or to
sin,” she added, “think of me at Berrie Down,
and of how your trouble would grieve me, Alick,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, there is no need for fear; I hope there
is no need.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope not, either,” she answered; “but yet who,
setting out to travel a strange road, can tell what
companions he may meet with by the way—what
troubles may assail him? More than all, Alick,”
and the sweet voice which was never hurried, never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>much excited, grew low and pleading as she spoke,
“If ever you do fall into any trouble, promise to
come and tell me; promise, whether I can help you
or not, to come and talk it over. If you cannot come
to me, I will go to you; and do not think any sin or
sorrow—however bad it may seem to you—too bad
to tell me. If you have to bear its consequences, I
can bear to hear of it. Promise me, Alick! If I
think you mean to keep no great sorrow from me, I
can let you go—not otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother—Heather—what are you afraid of?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid of nothing except the indefinite,”
she answered, through her tears. “It is a new
country to me this life on which you are entering.
Were I going to explore it myself, probably it
would not seem so terrible. Promise, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I promise,” he answered; and then their talk
flowed on to calmer ground—to such commonplace
affairs as, “where he should lodge, what amount of
worldly belongings he should take with him, what
edibles it would be advisable for Heather to send
for him to his London home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In all these minor matters Mrs. Dudley was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>intensely interested; not that the other subjects on
which she had touched lay farther from her heart,
but only that they seemed less within her province
than such homely affairs as seeing that his linen was
in proper order, that he had flannels for the winter,
and an abundant supply of towels and soap; to say
nothing of more animal luxuries, in the shape of
fresh butter, preserves, poultry, and eggs.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was arranged how all these necessaries, which
Mrs. Piggott believed were to be had genuine
nowhere out of Hertfordshire, could be forwarded
periodically to London; and then Heather set to
work on Alick’s wardrobe—condemning socks, examining
shirts, turning over collars, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick had better take everything new with him,”
she said to Agnes, “and leave these for Cuthbert;”
and the poor soul sighed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps she felt intuitively Alick would never
require her again to furnish him with an outfit—that
from the day his foot passed forth from Berrie Down
he would never need hosen nor shirt from her more.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great change was at hand, such as arrives to
the mother when her darling marries a husband able
to provide her with her heart’s desire, and more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>her heart’s desire, if such a thing were possible; to
the sister, whose brother’s wife takes from that day
forth to all eternity charge of the mending, airing
and making of an idol’s linen, and it was natural
at such an hour Heather should desire “her boy’s”
wardrobe to be unexceptionable, that she should
wish the very stitches in his collars, the very marking
of his clothes, to remind him of the “far-away
home,” where she would never cease praying he
might be kept from all the temptations of the world,
the flesh, and the devil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dear Heather; oh! dear, dear Heather! I know
cleverer women do greater things than your imagination
ever compassed—that they write books and
paint pictures, that they compose music and preach
sermons, that they scribble reviews and manage
warehouses, that they are owners of various business
establishments in the City, and serve writs to unsuspecting
debtors; and yet I doubt if all these mementoes
of women’s work and women’s talents would
rest so long in the mind as one sweet word from
you!</p>

<p class='c011'>All this time she had full leisure to devote to
Alick, for Arthur was away, staying at no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>place than Copt Hall, where, through the instrumentality
of Miss Alithea Hope, both he and
Heather had been invited to spend a week.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of his cousin, Arthur had hitherto known as little
as his cousin knew of him; but on her return to
Copt Hall, after many years of absence, it became
the desire of Miss Hope’s life to promote an intimacy
between the respective families.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is your own cousin,” she said to Walter Hope,
“and it is really scandalous that you do not visit each
other;” acting on which hint, often repeated, Mrs.
Walter Hope wrote a very gracious note to Heather,
trusting she and her husband would spare them a
few days before all the fine weather was gone. Mrs.
Walter Hope laid considerable stress on the point,
that she and Mr. Hope were much distressed at the
fact of such near relations and neighbours remaining
for so long a time comparative strangers. She
hoped for the future they should see more of each
other. She had heard so much about Mrs. Dudley
from dear Miss Hope that she felt as if she (Heather)
were quite an old acquaintance. She described the
best railway route from Palinsbridge to Foldam (the
station nearest to Copt Hall), just as if Arthur had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>never journeyed there in days gone by, and begged
to know on which day and by what train Mr. and
Mrs. Dudley were likely to arrive, in order that the
carriage might meet them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never was a more cordial letter penned, and
Arthur, with new prospects of wealth before him,
did not read it ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the contrary, he extracted an augury of success
from these overtures of friendship, and urged upon
Heather the advisability of accepting Mrs. Hope’s
invitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Heather did not wish to go, at least not at that
particular juncture. She had much to do, she told
Arthur. She had to set her household in order after
the summer visiting; she had to make and to
mend; she wanted to be with Alick during the
latter part of his sojourn at Berrie Down; she
was tired, really tired, of talking and company, and
desired rest; all of which reasons only provoked
Arthur, and caused him to declare that she thought
of every person except him, and acceded to every
person’s wishes except his.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Heather, with a smile, told him she knew
he was not in earnest, and added that she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>another reason for wishing to remain at home, viz.,
the state of her wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dress which is quite sufficient for me at Berrie
Down,” she said, “would scarcely he suitable at
Copt Hall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon that Arthur gave his wife a fifty-pound
note, and bade her get what she wanted; but Heather,
turning very white, folded up the note, and handed
it back to him, saying, “I would rather not, dear; I
would, indeed——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why not?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I do not think we can afford it,” she
answered, “at least not yet,” she added, seeing how
vexed he looked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not yet! Will you tell me what you mean,
Heather?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I mean, Arthur, that though you have not
told me anything of what you are doing, still, I cannot
be blind. I see the stock gone, the crops sold.
I know you are engaged in some business with Mr.
Black, and that there is money needed for it. You
would never have sold the crops so soon, had there
not been a necessity for selling them; and then,
Arthur, perhaps, when Christmas comes, you may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>want all the money we can save, and I should not
like to spend any unnecessarily now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall have money long before Christmas,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may,” she said, “but you may not. I
cannot tell what it is you are doing or expecting,
but——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang it!” broke in Arthur, “is a man bound to
tell his wife everything? When you can’t help
me—when you would only be trying to dissuade
me from my purpose, and keep me from ever
rising out of the slough of poverty in which I have
passed year after year—why should I talk to you
about what I am doing or expecting? Women’s
ideas are so contracted; they take such short views;
they are so cautious, and so fearful, and so fond of
certainties, that there is no use in even trying to
make confidantes of them. Because you are happy
yourself here, Heather, you think I ought to be so
too; because you can endure the cursed monotony of
such a life, you would keep me bound to the wheel
for ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you are a little mistaken,” she answered.
“I have been very happy here; I do love Berrie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Down very much; but I would leave it to-morrow,
and go with you anywhere in the world, if I thought
by so doing I could contribute to your comfort,
happiness, or prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you thought,” he repeated. “Ay, there’s
just the rub; you never could think so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If <em>you</em> thought that leaving Berrie Down would
make you happier, I would do it. I would do anything
for you. I have tried to please you, Arthur,”
she went on, speaking almost entreatingly. “I have
never contradicted your will. I have never put
myself in opposition to you. I have never teazed
you with questions. I have striven to do my best;
but, as you are not satisfied, tell me how I can do
better; and it shall not be my fault if I fail. Only,
Arthur, only don’t let us drift away from one
another; don’t let us begin to have secrets, and
treat me as though I had done something to
shake your trust and confidence in me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Never before had Arthur Dudley seen his wife
so moved; never before had he heard such a sentence
from her lips. For a moment he felt tempted
to tell her all; to make a full and ample confession;
to explain to her not merely that his stock was gone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and his crops also, but that he had put his “name”
on paper, to an extent which, if the Protector Bread
and Flour Company failed to fulfil the hopes of its
promoters, would certainly cripple his resources
seriously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course his name was only “lent;” but occasionally
misgivings would cross his mind that in the
event of any hitch occurring, he might be liable for
the whole amount of every bill which was at that
moment wandering about London, passing from
hand to hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the Protector “smashed up,” to use Mr.
Black’s concise phrase, Arthur Dudley would be
smashed up with it; he had gone on little by little,
till he was afraid of reckoning how much of Berrie
Down was set up in type at Printing House Square,
and in various newspapers throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the Protector failed—but then the Protector
could not fail—and because it could not fail, and
because if it did fail, so much must go with it,
Arthur decided not to tell his wife (who would be
certain to look on the worst side of things), but to
humour her, as Mr. Black recommended, and
answer—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“I do not know, Heather, what you mean by
drifting away; you and the children are never out
of my thoughts by day or night. I have gone into
a very good thing with Mr. Black, in company
with Lord Kemms, Mr. Allan Stewart, Mr. Aymescourt
Croft, and a number of other persons, all gentlemen
of position and fortune, not likely to rush
into any foolish speculation. I hope to be a wealthy
man yet. I hope to get rid of this eternal worry
about money—which makes life not worth the
having. I know you would help me, Heather, if you
could; there, there, don’t look pitiful. I can’t bear
it. There is nothing you can do for me now,
except buy yourself some handsome dresses, and
come over to Copt Hall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She put her hand out to take the money, then a
second time she returned it to him, saying, “Let
me have my own way this time, Arthur; when you
have made your fortune, I will spend as much money
as you like; only till you have made it, I should not
feel happy to be extravagant. Don’t be angry,
love!” she pleaded; “don’t be vexed because I ask
to have my own will for once in a way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Once in a way!” repeated Arthur. “Always,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>you mean, don’t you? No, I’m not angry; stay at
home, if you like. I do not think that there are
many husbands who would press their wives so much
to accompany them;” and with this undeniably true
remark, Arthur Dudley strode out of the room,
leaving Heather to think over the matter at her
leisure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very patiently she did so—very resolutely she
took up the facts of her married life, and looked at
them from beginning to end. There was nothing
new in what she saw—nothing. It had been coming
upon her for months past, that she did not possess—had
never possessed—her husband’s love. When she
beheld Gilbert Harcourt’s devotion to Bessie, she
knew Arthur had never been similarly devoted to
her. She was not the love of his life, and neither was
she the friend of his heart. He trusted in others;
he confided in others. What was the reason of all
this? Was it a fault in herself, she wondered. If
it were, how did it happen that the boys and the
girls, the men-servants and the maid-servants, and
the stranger who came within their gates, all turned
to her for sympathy and companionship? Without
any undue vanity, it was still impossible for Heather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>not to know that she was greatly beloved by those
with whom she came in contact; and yet, what was
the use of being beloved, if the one person on earth
she cared for threw her off?</p>

<p class='c011'>Threw her off! Had they ever been near enough
for him to do so; were not they quite as near now
as ever they had been? Was it not only the blessed
darkness of her mental vision which had hitherto
kept her from discovering this fact? “He never
loved me,” Heather decided—“never; and he has
found it out too late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then there came over her soul a terrible pity
for him, which swallowed up all sense of personal
wrong—all anger—all selfishness. She could not
unmarry him; she could not give him the woman he
might have loved, the wealth that might have made
him contented. She was no heroine—this Heather
of mine; tragedy was not in her nature. The idea
of freeing him from the yoke under which he had
voluntarily put his neck, never occurred to her. To
flee to the ends of the earth, to part from him,
leaving a note of insufficient explanation behind;
to rush off with the first man who whispered a few
civil words to her, and let her husband walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>through the Divorce Court to liberty; to purchase
a little bottle of poison and kill first her children
and then herself—these very feasible and proper
courses, were ideas which never even crossed Mrs.
Dudley’s mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside of lunatic asylums, amongst the decorous
and unexcitable people to be met with in society, or
when we take our walks abroad, we are told, by those
who profess to know their fellow-creatures thoroughly,
that such impulsive, devoted, unselfish creatures
exist; but Heather’s imagination never soared to such
heights of passionate self-sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were married, and the time for even
thinking of parting with Arthur being past for ever,
all she could do was to try to make him as happy as
possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>For who could tell? Like David, she thought that
the Lord might yet be gracious to her, that some
day, perhaps, Arthur would know how much she
loved him, and give her back a portion of love in
return.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, meantime, she never blinded herself—from
the hour knowledge began to dawn, she never
refused to open her eyes and see the dull grey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>morning-sky of reality which had broken for her.
Though she did not sit down and weep, still she made
no attempt to fly from the presence of her trouble.
There came no change over her face, unless it might be
that the look of which I have previously spoken, oftener
sat like a brooding shadow across her eyes. She
did not weary her husband with her affection, or load
him with caresses; yet, although an ordinary observer
could have detected no difference in her manner,
Arthur had long felt there was a change; that his
comfort was more considered, if that were possible,
than formerly; that his every wish was anticipated;
that his caprices were more attended to, his complainings
more rarely combated, than of old. He
felt there was a change, though he could not have
put a name on that change; and as it irritates sick
people to be humoured, so it irritated Arthur to find
that even the faint opposition of old was withdrawn—that,
let his commands be as unreasonable, as
fretful, as provoking as they would, they were still
obeyed implicitly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never, excepting where some question of right
and wrong was involved, did Heather lift up her
voice in opposition to his, and he was, therefore, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>more annoyed and surprised when Heather ventured
to demur about going to Copt Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So deucedly provoking, too, when I wanted her,
and just at this time,” he remarked to Mr. Black,
whom he met in London—that being the route he
took to Copt Hall—whereupon Mr. Black said,
consolingly—</p>

<p class='c011'>“That, perhaps, it was as well; Mrs. Dudley might
have put her foot in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She would have come if I had pressed her, you
know,” continued Arthur, not wishing Mr. Black to
believe Heather the better horse at Berrie Down;
“but I was not going to do that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had a bit of a tiff, I suppose, is about
the English of the matter,” commented Mr. Black.
“Well, such things will happen, even in the best-regulated
families.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We had no tiff,” answered Arthur; “my wife is
the last woman on earth to make a row about anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am aware of that, of course,” said Mr. Black,
drily; “but still she does not go to Copt Hall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! damn Copt Hall!” exclaimed Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, don’t do that yet—not, at any rate, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>we see if Walter Hope, Esquire, J.P., will appear on
our direction—eh!” suggested the promoter, poking
Arthur in the ribs, and winking slyly as he spoke.
“Never mind the wife, Dudley, she’ll come to, no
fear, when she sees our spec succeed, and you
keeping your carriage and horses, and having your
box at the Opera, and God knows what besides.
Don’t trouble yourself about any persons’ thoughts
now; their thoughts will be all right when you have
a clear five thousand a year, and the chance of
adding another five to that. Never fear; those that
win, laugh, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with this assurance Arthur departed for Copt
Hall, where he was most cordially received and
most hospitably entertained, and where he met
again, after years, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Aymescourt
Croft.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Heather remained at home, doubtful
whether she had done right in refusing to accompany
her husband, in throwing cold water on his proposal
that she should array herself like the Queen of Sheba,
and thus attired, repair to the courts of Arthur’s
relatives.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not decide the question to her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>contentment—she could not satisfy her understanding
as to whether, when a woman promises to
obey a man, she thereby excludes herself ever after
from all title to take up her own parable and express
her opinions boldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew other women had no such qualms of
conscience—that to most of the wives she knew
obedience was a dead letter; but this did not prevent
Heather fretting and fidgeting. She had vexed her
husband at a time when she wanted most to please
him, and he had told her before he left, when he
saw her busy with preparations for his brother’s departure,
that she “liked Alick better than she did
him—that she thought of studying every person’s
pleasure sooner than his.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know what to do, I am sure,” she
reflected, as she drove over to South Kemms in an
old tumble-down, rattling phaeton, that was the very
shame of Arthur’s life, but which she, nevertheless,
preferred to the, in her opinion, still more dilapidated
fly from the Green Man at Fifield, which was in the
habit of conveying visitors to Palinsbridge Station;
“I do not know what to do.” She had written every
day to Arthur since his departure, but never a line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>did he vouchsafe to her in return, and she was wondering
whether she ought or ought not to write
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, if I do not teaze him to answer, if I
merely send a line to say we are all well, it cannot
seem like worrying,” she decided; and having so
decided, she made her purchases (which were
principally in Alick’s interest) at South Kemms,
returning home with Ned, who was charioteer, as
the evening shadows were settling down upon the
Hollow.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she reached the door, Alick was there to
help her alight, and carry in her shawls, and wraps,
and parcels.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was full of her little purchases: a woman
must, indeed, be in a terrible state of despair—a
depth of despondency too great for a spectator to
contemplate calmly—when the prospect of opening
a draper’s parcel fails to send a thrill of expectant
pleasure through her heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take them into the dining-room, Alick,” she
said. “Oh! I am very glad to see that fire, it is so
cold out of doors;” and she walked into the apartment
and pulled off her bonnet and threw back her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>mantle, and stood with her hands stretched out
towards the blazing coals, warming her numbed
fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are the girls?” she asked, at length.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upstairs,” Alick answered, stooping over the
parcels he had brought in as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is anything the matter?” Heather asked, quickly
turning from the fire. He had only uttered
one word, and yet his tone filled her with a vague
alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is anything the matter?” she repeated, finding
he did not reply. “Alick, look at me; why do you
keep your face turned away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Alick looked up, but his eyes fell under
Heather’s scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick, tell me this instant what is the matter,”
she said. In a moment her fancy conjured up all
sorts of horrors—her husband was dead, there had
been a railway collision, perhaps. Thought is sometimes
as quick in our waking moments as in our
dreams; and her imagination flew to him over all
the miles that intervened between them. “You
have heard bad news,” she went on. “Is it about
Arthur; is he ill?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Not that I know of,” Alick answered. “But,
mother, we have had an accident since you went
away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An accident!” she repeated. “What kind of
an accident—what is it—who is it? Alick, you will
drive me mad if you stand there looking at me
without speaking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to speak, but he could not do it; he had
been nerving himself up to tell her, and now, when
the moment came for explanation, the words died
away upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heather,” he began, in a tone of deprecating
entreaty,—and then suddenly the truth flashed upon
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Lally,” she cried; “it’s Lally; oh! my child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He caught her as she was about to rush past him
out of the room. “Mother, mother,” he said,
“listen to me; she fell into the mill-pond, and they
brought her home, and the doctor is here, and we
have been doing everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she is dead!” finished Heather.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she is not,” said Agnes, entering at the
moment. “She has this instant opened her eyes;”
and she broke out sobbing almost hysterically.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Thank God!” exclaimed Alick, solemnly, after
the manner of a person rescued from some fearful
danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Heather, looking from one to the other,
understood that while she had been driving to South
Kemms, and making her purchases, and never thinking
of evil, her darling had been standing in the
very valley of the shadow—that she had brushed
garments with the angel of Death; and her first
feeling, when she did understand all this, was, not one
of gratitude that her child was saved, but of anger
and resentment at her ever having been permitted
to get into danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had not encountered the ordeal which
the younger Dudleys passed through while Lally
lay seemingly dead before them; she had not
fought for the child as they did, both before and
after the doctor’s arrival; she had not endured the
agony—an agony not to be described—which filled
Alick’s heart when he met the little body being
carried home across the fields; she had not ridden
for the doctor and followed him from house to house
as hard as the best horse in Arthur’s stables could
gallop; she had not stood in suspense by the bedside;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>she had not wondered with them, “How shall
we tell Heather—what will Heather say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>That had been the one thought of every person
in and about the house,—“What will Heather do;
what will Mrs. Dudley say!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The very regret for Lally seemed merged in
dread of her mother’s sufferings.</p>

<p class='c011'>How should any one face Heather and tell her
Lally’s life was still problematical? Who should
prove brave enough to break the tidings to her, and
look upon her agony?</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the whole of this suspense and anxiety
the younger Dudleys had passed; but how was
Heather to understand everything in a moment?
The only certainty she comprehended was that her
darling had been left to get into danger—that she
had almost lost her child; and so she cried aloud in
her terror and her anger,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was there not one of you that could have seen
to her—not one amongst you all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They never answered her—they could not tell
her then how it had come to pass; they were so
thankful at even a chance of life being given to
the child, that they did not mind the mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>reproaches, though it seemed strange to them to see
Heather angry.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are times when it appears a less weighty
trouble to behold a friend angry than sorry; and so
they bore her blame in silence, and made way for her
to pass out, only remarking—</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is very ill, remember; had you not almost
better stay downstairs for a little time longer?”</p>

<p class='c011'>As if she did not hear their words, Heather
walked blindly across the hall, groping her way to
the staircase. When Alick would have taken her
by the arm, she thrust his proffered help aside, and
guiding herself by the balusters managed somehow
to reach the first floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>There she paused, and put her hand to her head,
seemingly trying to remember something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is in your room,” Alick said, thinking she
wished to know where the child lay; but it was not
that; as she tried to move forward again, she
tottered, and, had Alick not caught her, would have
fallen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lay her on my bed,” Agnes whispered; and
Alick accordingly carried his burden into one of the
pleasant chambers, the windows of which, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>now looked forth on lifeless trees and bare brown
branches, waving mournfully to and fro in the
night, as the autumn wind rushed across the
deserted fields and over the Hollow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c009'>POOR LALLY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Time and tide, we are assured, wait for no man;
which, though a truth, is but a portion of one, since
happy would we be if, in this world, time and tide
were the only things that refused to delay their
departure for our convenience.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are many circumstances of our daily lives
against which it would be as vain to appeal—to
which it would serve quite as good a purpose to cry
aloud for mercy, as the typical hour and tide.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the first time in his life, Alick Dudley
realised this fact, when he found he must depart for
London, and leave Heather in the very midst of her
trouble, with no one at hand to “see after her,”
so the lad expressed himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Agnes, reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Yes; but you are not a man, Aggy,” he
answered; “that is the worst of it.” And though,
in some respects, Agnes was almost as good as a
man, still she sighed deeply, feeling her inferiority.</p>

<p class='c011'>What was there a man could not do? A man
could lift heavy weights, and think nothing about
them; a man could fling a saddle on a horse, and
put a bridle in his mouth, and gallop off for a
doctor, without first going about the house wondering
whom he could send; a man could jump into the
mill-pond and bring Lally out, holding her suspended
in mid-air, as a cat does its kitten; a man
could go out in all weathers, he could undertake to
break bad news; the very sound of his voice in the
house was a reassurance; his very tone of command
a trumpet which recalled the scattered senses of a
tribe of frightened females. Without Alick—boy
though he almost was—what would Berrie Down be?
a camp without a chief. Even if Arthur were back,
they would all miss Alick. He was so prompt, he
was so daring, he was so utterly unfeminine in
every respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, many feminine qualities were possessed by
Arthur; and, therefore, even if the Squire had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>at home, he could never have proved of the same
use in the house as his much younger brother
Alick.</p>

<p class='c011'>There has been a great deal written of late years
about masculine women. It seems rather one-sided
for no one to preach against feminine men; for if
a woman be objectionable in so far as she resemble
a man, a man must surely be objectionable in so far
as he is dependent, and weak, and timid, and faint-hearted,
and undecided, and variable, and impulsive,
and easily influenced, and speedily depressed, and
equally speedily rejoiced, and governed by the
opinions of others, and dependent on external influences,
like a woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>I lift my hand in supplications, and cry earnestly
for mercy, ladies, as I finish this sentence, which I
believe to be true as sorrow and pain. There is
another cry which is popular now-a-days, and the
man or the woman who raises an opposition shout is
likely to find small favour in the crowd; but the
opposition shout is none the worse for that.</p>

<p class='c011'>A man is a divine institution, even in a domestic
point of view. He may not be charming pottering
about a house, counting the camellias, and instituting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>inquiries into the items of a grocer’s bill; but he is
at a premium when a gun wants cleaning, or a
troublesome tramp grows insolent.</p>

<p class='c011'>In precise proportion as he fails to load his
pistols, or face a danger, whether moral or physical,
as he is lazy, self-indulgent, wanting in energy, his
merits fall below par; and the man, spite of his
sex, in point of usefulness is at a discount.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never at a discount Alick Dudley was likely to
be; and that truth, even while she sighed, Agnes
dimly grasped. She did not know, she really could
not imagine, what they were all to do without her
brother; more especially at that juncture, when
there was terrible sickness in the house—when,
more than ever before in her life, Heather wanted
help, and consolation, and encouragement. And
yet Alick must go; the laws of the Medes and
Persians were as likely to be reversed as the rules
hung up in the clerks’ office in the great warehouse
of Messrs. Elser, Wire, Hook, and Elser, Wood
Street, City.</p>

<p class='c011'>Time and tide would about as probably wait the
convenience of mankind, or humour the whims of
womankind, as those gentlemen accept as apology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>for Alick’s non-appearance the fact of his niece
being ill, and his sister-in-law in trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to the mood in which the firm chanced
to be, the members composing it would have
intimated to Alick, either that it was a matter of the
supremest indifference to them if the whole of his
relations were dead and buried, or suggested that
he had made a mistake in applying to them for a
situation, since it was evidently a nurse’s berth he
wanted at one of the hospitals.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, in whatever form of words they had couched
their rejection, that rejection would have certainly
been inevitable. No blame to the Messrs. Elser and
Co. Of course the world cannot stand still because
children fall ill, and women like to have their
male relations near them in times of trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather, indeed, would have been the first to
recognise this truth, had there arisen any question
concerning it; but in that quiet Hertfordshire home
it never occurred to a single soul within its walls that
there could be a moment’s hesitation in the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick had to go; and, accordingly, he packed up
his clothes, bade good-bye to “the mother,” not
without tears, kissed all his sisters, received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>quite a volume of maternal advice from Mrs. Piggott,
together with a box of sandwiches, prepared,
apparently, under an impression that he was
going to the Canary Isles, and had not the remotest
chance of getting anything to eat till he arrived there;
and, in the grey dawn, drove over in the pony cart
to Palinsbridge, where he caught the eight o’clock
up express, and entered the office of Messrs. Elser,
Wire, Hook, and Elser, at ten—the hour at which
he had been bidden to put in his first appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the same day two letters were posted at Fifield:
one to Arthur from Agnes—written in defiance of
Heather’s wishes—telling the Squire of Lally’s accident,
not lightly, as Heather had done, but fully
and circumstantially, and informing him how ill,
how very ill the child had remained ever since; and
another, which having been penned with a great expenditure
both of thought and ink, it may be as well to
print it <i><span lang="fr">in extenso</span></i>, for the information of my readers:</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Without photographing the original document,
which cost Miss Dobbin quite as much mental
anxiety as an official dispatch, it would be vain to
hope to give an idea of the sort of manuscript through
which Bessie Ormson at length arrived at the fact of
Lally’s serious illness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>It was blotted all over by accident and design. If
by chance Priscilla spelt a word rightly, so surely she
rubbed her finger through it, and wrote in another as
unlike what it ought to have been as can well be
imagined.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had not a capital letter in its proper place
from first to last, and it was many a day, in fact,
before Bessie fully mastered the contents of that
epistle.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she gathered enough, almost in a first perusal,
to convince her something was very wrong at the
Hollow; and, although she had no invitation from
Heather to do so, still she instantly resolved to
start for Berrie Down.</p>

<p class='c011'>With Bessie, as a rule, to resolve was to perform;
and, accordingly, that very same evening, she astonished
the Dudley household by walking coolly in
amongst her cousins as they were sitting down to
tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, and what is this about Lally?” she asked,
after she had kissed the girls, and inquired for
Heather; “what is the matter with her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did Alick not tell you?” answered the assembled
Dudleys in chorus.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Alick,” repeated Miss Ormson. “I have not
seen Alick. I only heard a vague rumour this morning
about something wonderful having occurred, and
so I thought that I would come down and learn the
certainties of the matter for myself. One of you
girls, I think, might have written to tell me; but I
suppose it is with you as with the rest of the world—out
of sight, out of mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heather would not let us write to any one,” said
Agnes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then Heather ought not to have had her own
way,” retorted Bessie; “and then, I suppose, she has
been up with that child night after night, taking no
rest, eating nothing, fretting herself to death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We all wanted to sit up,” exclaimed Lucy
Dudley, “but she would trust no person.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Precisely what I expected,” said Bessie, who
had by this time divested herself of cloak and
bonnet, and now stood beside the fire looking as
trim and pretty as though she had just stepped out
of her dressing-room. “And so Lally is very
bad?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is precisely what she says herself,”
answered Laura. “Whenever the pain leaves her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>for a minute or two, she settles down a little in the
bed and whispers, ‘Poor Lally’s very bad.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is she in danger?” asked Bessie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know; the doctor will not tell us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Arthur at home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; Heather would not let him know how ill
Lally was,” answered Agnes; “but I wrote yesterday—not
that I suppose he could do any good, if he
were here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She fell into the mill-pond?”—this was interrogative.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was pushed in,” answered Cuthbert, with a
vicious look towards Harry, who sat at the farthest
corner of the table with his legs tucked up under his
chair, a great slice of bread and butter and honey
in one hand, and a huge cup of tea in the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t push her in,” remarked that young
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, but you told Leonard to shove her,”
said Cuthbert, shaking his hand at his brother
menacingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, how was I to know she would topple over
like that?” persisted Harry. “If she was loose on
her perch, that wasn’t my fault, was it? and it’s not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>right of you to go on like that at me. Mrs. Dudley
said you wasn’t to do it; she came and she talked
to me, she did, and said she believed me, if nobody
else didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She must have great faith,” remarked Bessie,
meditatively. “If I had been here, Harry, I should
have taken you down to the pond and given you a
ducking on my own responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shouldn’t have cared if you had drowned me,
then,” retorted Harry. “There was not one of them
would speak to me, and Alick would not let even
Leonard come and say a word to me; and I was so
miserable, I often thought of going out at night and
throwing myself into the water, and that I knew would
vex them all—only I was afraid of crossing the fields
by myself in the dark;” and at the bare recollection
of his fear and trouble, Harry began to whimper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you had done that, you know,” said Bessie,
coolly, “you would have been buried at the four
cross-roads on the way to South Kemms, with a
stake through your body.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should not have minded what was done to me
when once I was dead,” said Harry, philosophically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you do not mind what you are about while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>you are living,” answered Bessie, “you will come to
the gallows.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No more likely to come to the gallows than
you, Miss Impudence, for all your red-and-white
face and shiny hair, that you think so much of;”
and Harry put out his tongue as far as he could
thrust it at Bessie, who, without “more ado,” to
appropriate an expression from Priscilla’s letter,
walked round the table, and would have boxed the
offender’s ears but that he disappeared from his
chair and dived among the feet of the four Dudleys,
one of whom, Cuthbert, was not slow about availing
himself of the tempting opportunity thus offered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re a coward,” said the boy, reappearing
on the other side with a very red face, and his hair
all in a tangle, looking, as Laura said, like one of
those things chimneys are swept with. “You’re a
coward, to kick a man when he’s down. Come on,
and fight it out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had better behave yourself, Harry,”
answered Cuthbert, “or I will give you toko for
yam,” which mysterious threat evidently conveyed
some definite idea to Master Marsden’s mind, for
he answered:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“You could not, nor two like you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I try?” asked Cuthbert, rising; but Harry
fled towards the door, and Agnes ended the quarrel
by bringing the boy back to the table and seating
him in his place, and warning both him and Cuthbert
that they must not make a noise—that the
doctor had said the house was to be kept as still and
quiet as possible. “So, Harry,” continued his sister,
“do be good for once in your life; finish your tea
and go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s the way,” grumbled Harry, his
mouth full of bread, and his lips smeary and
sticky with honey—“that’s the way; finish, and
go to bed; finish, and go into the garden; finish,
and see what the men are doing; it is always go,
go, go, from morning till night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you be quiet, and let other people hear
themselves talking?” said Bessie, sharply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are not many that would care to hear you
talk, at any rate,” retorted Master Marsden; “it is
gab—gab—gab; bub—a bub—a bub—wherever you
are, just like a meat-fly, or a wasp, or a mosquito.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I declare, Harry, I will write to your papa,”
averred Bessie, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Write—who cares—and send somebody to read
it, will you? We always call yours fat writing at
home, and pa says if there was many hands like it,
ink could not be made fast enough to supply people.
Writing, do you call it? I could write as well
with a paste-brush.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you going to be quiet, Harry, or are you
not?” asked Bessie, taking a step towards him; “for,
if you make another saucy speech, I will box your
ears, as sure as my name is Bessie Ormson.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who gave you that name?” mocked the boy;
whereupon Bessie proved as good as her word, and,
seizing him, was about to administer condign punishment,
when Harry cried out—</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you do—if you do—I’ll make a noise, and
then Mrs. Dudley will come down to know what is
the matter, and then I’ll tell her, and then she’ll be
angry with you, for she said nobody was to speak
crossly to me while I stayed in the house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is quite true,” Agnes said, in answer to
Bessie’s look of inquiry. “She thought we were
not kind to him, and scolded him about Lally;
and in the middle of all her own trouble, of course,
she had time to consider Harry. You see the result.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“And pray, Harry, how long are you going to
stay in the house?” inquired Bessie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As long as I like—as long as I find it convenient,”
replied the boy; “but now, I tell you
what; I am quiet mostly, not because I care a
button for all their threats, but because I promised
Mrs. Dudley I would—there now!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are a curiosity,” remarked Bessie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so much of one as you are. I don’t wear
frizzle-gigs of things in my hair; I don’t live in a
steel cage; I don’t screw myself in round the waist
and walk this way,” added Master Marsden, marching
up and down the room in a style which he firmly
believed to be an exact imitation of Bessie. “I don’t
look from under my parasol—so! and make up my
face when anybody is in the room I want to think
well of me; I don’t wear kicking straps and dress
improvers to make my petticoats stick out—like
that;” and Master Marsden pulled out his knickerbockers
to their fullest width, and treated society to
another representation of Bessie “sailing across a
room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>If every one belonging to her had been dying
at that moment, Bessie could not have refrained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>from laughing; and in this mirth her cousins
joined.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose Harry thinks that is holding the
mirror up to nature,” said Lucy Dudley, at length.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Harry does not,” retorted the young gentleman;
“he thinks it is holding the mirror up to art.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am art, then, am I?” inquired Bessie; and
Harry nodded assent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” she said, “since it seems you have engaged
this room for your performances, I will go
upstairs and see Heather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had not I better go up first, and tell her?”
suggested Agnes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no,” answered Bessie; “good wine, you
know, needs no bush;” and with that she left the
apartment, and ascended to the sick chamber, at the
threshold of which she paused for a moment irresolute.</p>

<p class='c011'>The door stood wide open, and across the entrance
was hung a curtain, so that the watchers could pass
in and out noiselessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lightly Bessie lifted this curtain, and looked in.
On the bed lay Lally, quiet enough to have satisfied
all Mrs. Ormson’s requirements—quiet enough and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>changed enough—a mere shadow of the Lally Bessie
had scolded and teazed, and loved and petted in the
glorious summer weather—a poor wasted little
Lally—a Lally who was, as she herself said, “very
bad indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And beside the bed sat Heather, looking so pale
and worn that it might well have been supposed she
also had passed through very grievous sickness.
The blue-veined lids were closed over the weary,
aching eyes, when Bessie first lifted the curtain;
but she had scarcely time to glance at the child and
her mother, before Heather, feeling there was some
one standing in the doorway, awoke and recognised
her visitor with a start of glad surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Making a sign for Bessie not to make a noise,
she rose and came across the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I only heard this morning,” the girl whispered,
“and I could not rest. How is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better, I trust,” Heather answered. They were
by this time in Bessie’s old apartment, which looked
as though she had only left it about an hour previously.
That was the beauty of the Hollow—any
one could drop into his accustomed place there, even
after long absence, in five minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Heather dear, you have suffered dreadfully.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but God has been very merciful,” Mrs.
Dudley answered. “Oh! Bessie, if she had died
without my seeing her, I could not have borne it;
there is no use in saying I could, for my heart must
have broken. She has been frightfully ill. She was
so long in the water, and then lying in her wet
clothes while they carried her here. It was this
side of the pond, you know, Bessie; and though
Mr. Scrotter’s house might have been nearer, still it
could not have made much difference in her recovery,
and it has made all the difference to me
having her at home. Fortunately, there were good
fires in the house, and plenty of hot water. If there
had been any longer delay, we cannot tell how it
might have turned out. The girls and Mrs. Piggott,
Doctor Williams says, really saved her life; but I do
not know—it seems to me everybody did what was
possible. The worst of it was her being so long in
the water, and so warm when she fell in—they had
been racing, it appears; but if we can get her over
this—and, please God, she will get over it—Doctor
Williams assures me there is no reason why she
should not be as strong as ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“I have come down to help you nurse her,”
said Bessie. “Now, don’t begin making objections,
Heather, because I know every sentence you would
speak, and all I intend to reply is, that I mean to do
my share of the watching, or else let Agnes take
it in turns with you, and I will try and see to things
about the house—only I am resolved you shall not
kill yourself. What will Arthur say when he comes
home, and sees you looking like a ghost? I declare,
if I met you in the dark you would frighten me.
Now, you shall lie down on the sofa to-night, and I
will sit beside Lally.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you will be completely knocked up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not know much about my constitution,
evidently,” answered Bessie, smiling: and thus the
difficult matter was arranged, and thus once again
Bessie Ormson became an inmate of the Hollow,
where Arthur arrived on the following day, greatly
to Heather’s vexation; for she had tried to keep
this trouble from him, not wishing, poor soul, to
“spoil his holiday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Agnes’ letter was so imperative, that the
moment he read it he packed his portmanteau,
asked his cousin to let him have the dog-cart as far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>as Foldam Station, and travelled by various circuitous
routes from that out-of-the-world-place to Hertford,
where he thanked Heaven when he exchanged the
Eastern Counties line of rail for the Great Northern.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That Copt Hall is the most cursed place in
England to get either to or from,” he remarked to
Bessie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard some ignorant people remark that
Berrie Down Hollow is not the most accessible spot
on earth; and I know I thought it rather out of the
way the other evening,” answered Miss Ormson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is next door to everywhere in comparison to
Copt Hall,” he replied.—“So you really think,” he
went on to say, “there is no fear for Lally now—little
monkey! Heather looks bad, though, does not
she? I declare, Bessie, it was very kind indeed of you
to come down, and I am greatly obliged to you for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Arthur,” answered Bessie, demurely;
“it is a happiness to know that my poor endeavours to
give satisfaction have found favour in your eyes.” But
although Miss Ormson replied to his gracious speech
with so little appearance of astonishment, still she
was secretly greatly surprised at the increased
urbanity of his manners. “Arthur is growing like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>other people,” she said to Agnes Dudley. “Saul
is coming among the Prophets. I wonder if the
Protector Bread Company have had any share in
effecting this great change; if so, success to it, say
I; may its career be happy and glorious—may its
dividends prove satisfactory, and my uncle grow
more prosperous, and more like a Puffin than ever!”
And then she returned to her watch beside Lally,
who crept out of absolute danger, surely though
slowly, and at length grew strong enough to sit up
in bed, supported by pillows, and toss over scraps of
coloured ribbons and bits of silk that Bessie would
spread out over the coverlet for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a minute or two, however, she would get
weary of this game; the red and the blue would
begin to dazzle her eyes; the little hands would
grow too weak to toy among the bright trifles; the
head would get tired with trying to raise itself over
the edge of the sheet; and when all these things
came to pass, Lally would drop the latest scrap of
silk—heave a heavy sigh—look piteously at Bessie,
and declare “Lally’s very bad aden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you are not,” Bessie invariably answered;
“you are scheming—you like being in bed this cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>weather, and having nice things to eat, and being
made much of; but wait a little. Some fine morning
I will rout you up, and chase you about the
lawn, and run you to earth in the Hollow. Won’t
I; do you think I won’t?” and the lovely face was
laid on the pillow beside the child, and Lally made
nests for herself in Bessie’s hair, and was fain to
fall asleep holding on by her pretty nurse’s gown,
or sleeve, or collar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh Lor, Miss, ain’t she like wax-work!” remarked
Priscilla Dobbin, the first time she beheld
Lally sitting up on Miss Ormson’s lap—held in Miss
Ormson’s arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is much more like bone-work to my mind,”
answered Bessie, kissing the little white arms; “but
we are going to feed her up, and send her to market
next time her papa goes to London—are not we,
Lally?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Lally, complaisant as ever, answered, while
busily engaged in counting over the buttons on
Bessie’s dress, “Iss.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c009'>MR. BLACK’S TARTAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Peter Black, Esquire, of Stanley Crescent, sat in
the Secretary’s room at the temporary offices of the
Protector Bread and Flour Company, Limited, 220,
Dowgate Hill, looking as much like a thrashed
hound as it was possible for so pompous, and prosperous,
and self-sufficient a gentleman to look.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a rule, wherever he went, and with whatsoever
manner of person he came in contact, Mr. Black
comported himself as if, so Mr. Ormson familiarly
said, “he was cock of the walk;” but now Mr.
Black had met with a bigger and stronger, and
more arrogant cock than himself; a bird whose
beak was strong and spurs sharp—who was accustomed
to lording it over creatures of his own species—who
would have been immensely astonished had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Mr. Black flown at him, and disputed his supremacy;
but who, had such an affront been offered,
would soon have cowed and discomforted his
adversary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Black, however, mindful perhaps of his victories
on other fields, was content to rest on his
laurels, and refrained from striving to wrest any
from the crown that bound in City circles the
brow of Allan Stewart, Esquire, of Walsey Manor,
Layford; Careyby Castle, Perthshire; Hyde Park
Gardens, London; and 92, King’s Arms Yard,
Moorgate Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a man who gave himself airs, Mr. Black
might perhaps have tried to get the mastery with
success. He might have deferred, and flattered, and
listened with apparent earnestness, while all the time
he was winding his opponent round his finger; but
Mr. Stewart gave himself no airs; he did not aw—aw
like the half-pay majors and poor middle-aged,
dilapidated, disreputable swells with whom Mr.
Black had so often come in contact. He did not
quote Latin, and talk of his great friends, like the
patientless doctors and surgeons, and the parishless
parsons and the clientless lawyers, who also had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>unto Mr. Black’s eyes familiar as the breath of life
in his nostrils.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not recklessly indifferent to results,
shamelessly greedy concerning money, openly careless
as to whether a scheme floated or not, so long
as he got out safe and netted a few hundreds, after
the fashion of the insolvent esquires and bankrupt
merchants, who would not—so Mr. Stewart declared—have
scrupled to put their names on the direction
of a railway to the infernal regions, if only such
statistics with regard to fares had been procurable
as would have enabled them to show shareholders
a prospect of a large dividend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They would glibly tell the British public what
Charon clears per annum, and state that great inconvenience
was felt by passengers when the Styx was
rough and the winds contrary. They would sell
their names to anything on the earth, or in the
waters under the earth; in land, or sea, or sky; in
this world or the next, if only promoters’ and
directors’ fees were to be had out of the scheme.
Those are the kind of men you have been accustomed
to deal with, Mr. Black. It may save us,
therefore, a vast amount of trouble hereafter if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>clearly understand now that I am a different sort of
man altogether.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Black inclined his head, and observed, somewhat
confusedly, that he did not doubt it in the
least.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me,” said Mr. Stewart, “but you did
doubt it. You thought when you paid me that
money, and promised me so many shares, and I
gave you leave to use my name, and said I should
go into the thing with you, that there was an end
of me. You thought, when you heard I was
abroad in the autumn, and at Walsey since my
return, that I meant to leave the company in your
hands, and meddle no further in the matter; but,
pray, do not think so any longer. I intend to take
an active part in this business. I mean that it shall
succeed; and I have not the slightest scruple in
informing you that it shall not be made a refuge for
the destitute by anybody.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am at a loss to follow your meaning, Mr.
Stewart,” said Mr. Black, in answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will try to explain myself more clearly,” went
on the great man. “When you came to me, and
I said I could not entertain your proposal without a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>retainer, do you know what my object was? No!
Well, then, I took your five hundred pounds as a
guarantee for your honesty. The sum was nothing
to me; but I had no intention of having my time
taken up about a company, the shares in which
might never be worth <em>that</em>!” and Mr. Stewart
snapped his fingers contemptuously. “I am perfectly
plain, you see. I knew you had been connected
with company after company. I knew, in
fact, you were by profession a promoter of very bad
schemes; but I knew, also, you had plenty of push,
and that, if you saw it was worth your while to make
a company succeed, you stood a fair chance of
forcing it to do so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Black bowed. These were the first civil
words Mr. Stewart had addressed to him during the
interview; and, although the amount of compliment
they contained might not be excessive, still there
was a certain recognition of his executive and
imaginative talents conveyed in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>For which reason Mr. Black bowed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, if the thing be to succeed, it must not be
swamped with sinecures and a multitude of ground
landlords.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Well enough Mr. Black knew all Mr. Stewart
implied by that sentence; but, nevertheless, he asked
him for further information.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By ground landlords, I understand a number of
persons who, considering the newly-discovered land
their own, want to make off it as much as they can
before anybody else touches a farthing—for instance,
you are a ground landlord. Quite as well as I you
know that Crossenhams’ mills are not worth the
name of the price you have put upon them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I assure you it is the very lowest price the
Messrs. Crossenham would take.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that lowest price you share with them. I
am not quarrelling with such an arrangement. The
prospectus could not have been put forth without
some mills being secured—and, perhaps, those mills
are as good for the purpose of advertising from as
any other; but still I happen to know all the ins
and outs of that transaction,—that your paper has
been keeping Crossenham afloat, that the machinery
is very old, that the buildings are very dilapidated,
and that, in fact, if you had not rushed to the
rescue, Messrs. Bailey and Robert Crossenham
must have been gazetted ere this, and that, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>event of such a calamity happening to them, the
premises could have been bought for an old song.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What has that to do with me?” asked Mr.
Black. “A man must live; and, like you, I cannot
afford to spend all my time, and strength, and thought,
and money, only to receive payment in shares.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” said Mr. Stewart, with a dubious smile,
which, however, encouraged the promoter to remark
further—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The labourer is worthy of his hire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph! that depends,” observed Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On what?” asked Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On how much work the labourer does, and on
the extent of his hire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” murmured the promoter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your hire has not been excessive, as hire goes,”
went on Mr. Stewart, “<em>so far</em>; but I think you have
run about the length of your just tether. I suppose,
Mr. Black, you are now satisfied, and mean for the
future to rest content, with your extremely moderate
supply of paid-up shares?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you think I was going to <em>give</em> the public
this company?” demanded the promoter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I had ever entertained such an idea—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>I never did—you would speedily have disabused me of
it,” answered Mr. Stewart; “but the point on which I
now desire information is this: Are you going to be
content with your promoter’s fees, with your shares,
with your profits on the Stangate mills, with your commission
on printing, advertising, travelling, and the
Lord knows what besides, or are you not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I desire to make no further claim,” answered
Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then what is the English of this item—‘Lease
of premises in Lincoln’s Inn Fields?’” demanded
Mr. Stewart, referring to a paper in his hand.
“What the devil do you mean by even proposing
that the offices of the company should be stuck up
there? We shall next be paying for the goodwills of
depôts in Highbury New Park and Camden Square.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not see why the offices should not be in
Lincoln’s Inn Fields,” observed Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I do not see why they should be in any
such graveyard,” answered Mr. Stewart. “Deuce a
thing there is in Lincoln’s Inn except lawyers’ offices,
and one or two places where they insure lives, and
preserve skeletons, and grant licences to kill. What
connection has Lincoln’s Inn with bread-making?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>I must bring this matter before the board, but
thought, in the first instance, I would give you a
chance of explaining yourself to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Black looked at the speaker, and turned the last
clause of his sentence over before replying.
Meanwhile, Mr. Stewart stood on the hearth-rug,
with his coat-tails tucked up over his arms, airing
himself in true British fashion in front of the fire.
In this attitude he looked a man of whom no person
would have cared to solicit a cheque—to whom no
defaulting debtor would have cared to prefer a
petition for time in which to pay.</p>

<p class='c011'>A gentlemanly-looking individual, no doubt, who
could have handed Lady Grace down to dinner in
an aristocratic and suitable manner—who could
have received one of the blood royal after the fashion
which is popularly supposed to obtain at Court
ceremonials; a very charming personage, doubtless,
when complimenting young ladies on their singing,
or asking materfamilias if all those velvet-tuniced
lads were hers; but not a nice man with whom to
discuss money matters, not a pleasant man to try
to take in—to strive to wind round your finger—to
endeavour to make use of.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Vaguely, Mr. Black, looking up at his grey-haired,
hard-featured, plain-spoken visitor, grasped all this
ere he answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lincoln’s Inn Fields is as good a place as any
other in which to have our permanent offices. The
address reads well. It implies to the country imaginative
lawyers; and lawyers, it pleases country
people to think, know what they are about. Further,
it is central. Gentlemen will not get their broughams
knocked to pieces coming there, as they would do if
they ventured with West End coachmen into the city.
Moreover, if strangers staying at an hotel ask for
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, any idiot of a waiter can direct
them to the place. There is something about the
sound of Lincoln’s Inn Fields which recommends
itself to me. I cannot think why you object to the
situation, Mr. Stewart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I object,” answered Mr. Stewart, “on two
grounds: first, that I consider Lincoln’s Inn Fields
an unsuitable position; and secondly, that I consider
the whole affair a job.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A job!” repeated Mr. Black, reddening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir, a job,” was the reply. “Who is this
Mr. Dudley? How does he chance to be the owner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>of that desirable leasehold property which you are
trying to get the company to buy? I see his name
on the direction. Who is he?—what is he? Is
there such a person as Arthur Dudley, Esquire? Is
there such a place as Berrie Down Hollow at
all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What have I done, Mr. Stewart, to justify such
suspicion?” the promoter virtuously demanded.
“Have I tried to deceive you; have I made any
false representations; did I enlist you in our ranks
by any undue means? If you are not satisfied with
the company and with me, why not resign; why not
disassociate yourself from us <i><span lang="la">in toto</span></i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Stewart laughed. “How long would your
company live without me?” he asked; “how long
would your other directors remain on the board, if I
withdrew my name from it? Rather, Mr. Black, I
might say, if you do not relish my interference, why
do you not resign, why do you not take your shares
and your promoter’s fees, and your various little
perquisites, and devote yourself to those other companies
which have very decidedly been neglected
while you were employed in dry-nursing the Protector
Bread and Flour Company, Limited?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“That, then, is what you want me to do?” said
Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I only, following your lead, suggested a
course which I thought you might find it advisable
to pursue. I mean to interfere in this company. I
mean that it shall pay, and I do not mean that
it shall expend enormous sums on the purchase of
freehold, copyhold, or leasehold property, when
renting offices and shops will serve our purpose
equally well, or better. That house in Lincoln’s
Inn Fields shall not be bought—at that point I
take my stand. The proposal is ridiculous; the situation
is undesirable; the price asked preposterous.
Mr. Dudley seems not to be overwhelmed with
modesty, or he never would have even thought of
mentioning such a sum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He knows nothing on earth of the value of property,”
Mr. Black declared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, then it is your price. I thought as much;
and you are to share the profit with him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” the promoter eagerly replied; glad, at
last, perhaps, to find some point where he could contradict
Mr. Stewart with advantage. “No, Mr.
Dudley is the person who found the capital to work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>this company. So far, he has not derived one
shilling benefit from it. He is not a business man;
he has gone into this scheme solely on my recommendation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he an idiot?” asked Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not associated much with idiots,” was the
reply, “and am therefore less competent to decide
that question than you might be. But I should say,
no. Considering he is a gentleman, and apt to
believe what people tell him, I never saw any especial
weakness of intellect about him. He is not
rich, and yet he has, as I said, found the money to
carry this matter through. When those premises
in Lincoln’s Inn were for sale, I advised him to buy
them, and promised that they should be purchased
by the company at a considerable advance on the
price he paid. I consider the sum asked a fair
sum; whether he make a profit or not, is no concern
of ours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of mine, you mean,” amended Mr. Stewart.
“It may be very much of your concern.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not to have a penny piece out of the
transaction, if that be what you would imply,” Mr.
Black replied.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“That was what I intended to imply,” said the
other; “and if it be a fair question, Mr. Black,
how did you chance to meet with this <i><span lang="la">rara avis</span></i>, who
found the money to start your company and believed
all you told him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Many a time in his life Mr. Black had been
bullied, and rebuffed, and snubbed, and irritated,
but never before, never, had he been so coolly
insulted—so insolently addressed, as by the very
ordinary-looking, elderly individual, who, still airing
himself at the fire, looked the promoter over—turned
him inside out, as calmly as though Mr.
Black had been a bale of inferior goods submitted
to his inspection.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an offensive superiority in Mr. Stewart’s
manner which was very gall and wormwood to the
person he addressed. Mr. Black would have liked to
order him out of the office, and to have enforced that
order with a due administration of boot leather; but,
recollecting that kicking Mr. Stewart out would not
help him personally along the road to fortune, he
wisely restrained his feelings, and answered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not consider your question a fair one at
all, sir. I never before came in contact with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>gentleman who would not have hesitated about
inquiring into such private particulars; but I have
no objection to telling you how Mr. Dudley and
I became acquainted. My wife is his aunt by
marriage; that is how I came to know anything
of Squire Dudley, of Berrie Down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now what the deuce does that mean?” said Mr.
Stewart, reflectively; “aunt by marriage. You are
not Mr. Dudley’s uncle, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then is Mrs. Black’s sister Mrs. Dudley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was until after her husband’s death, when
she married a second time. There were four
sisters,” glibly proceeded Mr. Black, “all daughters
of Alderman Cuthbert; one died young, unmarried.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The gods loved her, then, we may conclude,”
said Mr. Stewart, grimly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The eldest daughter married Mr. Ormson, of
Cushion Court, with whose name, I dare say, you
are well acquainted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, as that of a very honest, respectable man,”
acquiesced Mr. Stewart, in a tone which implied
that he never expected to hear one-half so much
good of the person he addressed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“The second did me the honour of linking her
fortunes with mine,” went on Mr. Black, at which
speech his auditor smiled again, not pleasantly.
“The youngest married Major Dudley, of Berrie
Down, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is, consequently, this Squire Dudley’s mother,”
suggested Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, his mother-in-law,” amended the promoter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stepmother, you would say, I presume,” corrected
Mr. Stewart. “So that is the relationship,
is it?” and apparently he constructed a genealogical
tree for his own edification on the instant,
where hung prominently a matrimonial excrescence,
with a pretty face and vulgar manners, sister-in-law
to Peter Black, Esquire, of Stanley Crescent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Major Dudley’s first wife, the present Squire
Dudley’s mother, was a daughter of Arthur Hope,
Esquire, of Copt Hall, Essex.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may have observed Mr. Walter Hope’s
name on our direction?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I did notice it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can make what inquiries you please about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Squire Dudley,” went on Mr. Black; “indeed, the
more inquiries you make, the better I shall be
pleased. His position is perfectly unimpeachable.
Excepting that he has not so much money as his
friends could wish, I am not aware that there is a
fault to be found with him or his surroundings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For a man short of money, the purchase of a
house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields was surely a venture,”
remarked Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He bought it, as I have said, on my advice,”
answered Mr. Black, who could be brave on occasion;
brave as well as self-asserting. “I thought, considering
that with me originated the idea of this
company; with me rested its very existence; on me
devolved the organizing, carrying out, and perfecting
of this scheme; I thought, I say, considering
all these things, that when the concern came to be
floated, a few of my suggestions would be received,
and that I might do, at once, a good stroke of
business for the company with which I was connected,
and for the man who had stood by me
and backed me up through thick and thin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your imagination outran your discretion, then,”
remarked Mr. Stewart. “It is a dangerous thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>for a man to try to benefit other people. Observe,
the financial field has been reaped almost bare
before he thinks of his acquaintances. You reaped
and gleaned, Mr. Black, and then you wanted
a second crop for your friend. We allow your
claims, but the claims of your acquaintances and
relations must go to the wall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will give up three hundred of my claim on the
mills, Mr. Stewart, if you do not oppose the purchase
of those premises in Lincoln’s Inn Fields,”
said the promoter, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then the affair is serious?” suggested Mr.
Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very serious,” answered Mr. Black.
“Here is a man with property, worth, at the
outside, ten thousand pounds, shall we say, and he
advances money for advertising, and backs us up in
every possible way with money, influence, connections.
As a douceur for that, I advise him to buy
that damned place in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, fully
intending that he should receive a good price for it
from our company; and now you come, Mr. Stewart,
and put your foot in it; you come interfering, and
meddling, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Mr. Black, do you know how many shares I
hold in this company?” asked Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A couple of hundred,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly two thousand,” answered Mr. Stewart,
“and I mean them to repay me. They will not do
so, as I said before, if we commence by making this
company a refuge for the destitute; and although, no
doubt, your friend Dudley is a delightful fellow and
a confounded fool, still, with him I take my stand.
Those premises may be rented if you will, but
never purchased. Please to remember what I say,
Mr. Black—never purchased.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Utterly crestfallen the promoter looked—utterly
like a thrashed hound or a disappointed pickpocket.
Stronger and stronger grew the inclination
to kick Mr. Stewart off the premises;
feebler and feebler grew his hopes of controlling the
operations of the Protector Bread Company,
Limited; and through all there was an awful sense
of injustice—of it being a sin for him not to be able
to do what he liked with “his own;” with the baby
he had conceived and brought into the world, and
nursed into a great prosperous creature, the shares
in which were already being eagerly inquired for.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Then, what is Dudley to do?” he asked, feebly
and impotently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sell the place again as soon as possible,” advised
Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is all very well; but if he cannot sell?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In that case he must let.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if he do not let?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In that case he must make the best he can of
a bad bargain,”—and Mr. Stewart shrugged his
shoulders, as much as to say, “If a man will be a
simpleton, he must bear the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The matter shall come before the board,” remarked
Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is nothing to prevent its doing so, is
there?” inquired Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I wish to Heaven, sir—I wish to Heaven—I
had been content to abide by good advice, and never
asked you for your name, or influence, or—or anything,”
finished Mr. Black, in a fine frenzy. “I
could have carried the company through without your
help; I should have been better without your interference;
I should have had the management, to a
certain extent, in my own power, instead——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Instead of having some one on the direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>with an interest in the well-being of the concern,”
finished Mr. Stewart, who had by this time changed
his position, and stood with one arm resting on the
chimney-piece, staring into the fire. “Look here,
sir,” he went on, suddenly altering the tone in which
he had hitherto spoken, “it is as much your interest
as mine that this company shall succeed. It may
make a rich man of you if it do—it will certainly ease
me of a considerable sum of money if it do not. Our
hopes, therefore, are, or should be, identical. Is it
to be peace or war between us? Will you work
with me, or will you work against me? Are you
going to make posts and give salaries to all the men
you ever knew since you started in business? Do
you mean to show Squire This and Captain That
where a good stroke of business is to be done—where
a snug nest-egg is to be obtained? Are you going
to advance the well-being of the company, or make
it subservient to the well-being of Jack, Tom, and
Harry? How is this to be, sir?—let us clearly
understand one another at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is all this tirade merely because I advised
Squire Dudley to purchase that house in Lincoln’s
Inn Fields?” asked Mr. Black, sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“No, sir; all this tirade, as you are pleased to
call it, originates not at the doings in Lincoln’s Inn,
but at the various other doings in Dowgate Hill.
Here, for example, who the deuce is this fellow
Harcourt, solicitor? Nobody knows who he may be,
except that he is some friend or relative of yours.
Then, again, there is Bayley Crossenham, Esquire,
manager; Robert Crossenham, Esquire, secretary <i><span lang="la">pro
tem.</span></i> It shall not be <i><span lang="la">pro tem.</span></i> long, believe me.
Then the bankers are your own; the auditors are the
same whose names were appended to that most rotten
scheme of yours, the City and Suburban Gas Company;
the brokers are men of comparatively no
standing whatever; not a soul on the direction but
has been “qualified” by the gift of paid-up shares.
I do not quarrel with that latter arrangement, for,
with one exception, I think you have, so far as I
can see, got a list of very good names—names that,
perhaps, were worth paying for. By the way, I perceive
Lord Kemms is on the Direction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” replied Mr. Black, wincing, however, a
little at the implied question; “he is next neighbour
almost to Squire Dudley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, what a delightful person this Squire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Dudley must be! And so, because Lord Kemms
chances to be near neighbour to Squire Dudley, he
allows his name to grace our prospectus? I should
not have thought it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should you not?” asked Mr. Black, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, for one reason, because he has been at
Vienna for the last four months.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw him, at any rate, in Squire Dudley’s
house, when I was down in Hertfordshire last
summer,” answered Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he gave you permission to use his name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly. Do you think I should put it on the
direction if he had not?” asked Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you any letter from him to that effect—any
written authority to do so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even in the City we think a man’s word sufficient
authority,” was the reply. “I do not know what
code of honour may be observed among your relations,
Mr. Stewart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is best not to depend too much on honour,”
answered that gentleman, coolly. “If Lord Kemms
took it into his head, on his return home, to repudiate
the transaction, do you know what would be
the result?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Our company would probably find itself in
Queer Street,” replied Mr. Black; “but I am not
afraid of that. Lord Kemms is not a man to back
out of a promise, particularly if it can be made
worth his while to keep it,” added the promoter,
<i><span lang="it">sotto voce</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not quite catch the last portion of your
sentence,” remarked Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was of no consequence—merely a passing
reflection,” said Mr. Black. “I can show you
Mr. Hope’s authority, and that of your nephew,
Mr. Croft, if the sight would afford you any gratification.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you—they are of no consequence,” was
the reply. “I should have liked to see Lord Kemms’,
because, from ‘information I have received,’ I did
not think his lordship would join us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He would not have joined us had Mr. Raidsford’s
persuasion carried much weight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed! Who is Mr. Raidsford—his confessor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, come, Mr. Stewart, do you think I am
quite a simpleton?” demanded Mr. Black. “Do
you imagine that piece of acting can take me in?
I know who has been setting you against me—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>know who has been putting you up to ask if the
names are genuine—if permission to use them have
really been given. You have not so long left Mr.
Raidsford’s office as to have forgotten who and what
he is; and I know who and what he is—a sneak and
a toady, who has worked himself up from nothing
with a smooth tongue and a spying nature. It was
through tale-bearing he got on—perhaps it will be
through tale-bearing he may get down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is rich, then?”—this was interrogative.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Stewart,” said the promoter, desperately,
“don’t you know all about Compton Raidsford, as
well as I know about you? Don’t you know he is
very rich—so rich that he would not touch shares in
the Bank of England? Don’t you know he hates
all companies—that having grubbed his own way
up, he believes anybody else can grub up unassisted
also? Don’t you know he is a prying, meddling,
conceited, cursed upstart?” finished Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot say that I do—in fact, I cannot say
that I know the man at all,” answered Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you need not say, but I may think,”
snapped up Mr. Black; “and, with regard to the
question you put to me some time since, all I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>got to remark is this—I will work with you, and for
you and myself, if you will let me; but there is a
limit to all things. I cannot stand being bullied
and interfered with. Let me work the company
my own way, and I will take what amount of advice
you choose to give, and act on it if I can. I am a
good servant, if I am let alone—interfere with this,
that, and the other, and I am apt to turn restive. If
you take the right way with me, you will not find
me unreasonable; but I tell you fairly to begin
with, that though a child might lead, the devil
himself should not drive me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must advertise for an intelligent three-year-old,
then,” laughed Mr. Stewart, “for I shall certainly
not attempt driving you. Only, I mean
to have my way in some things, remember. I am a
little like you, Mr. Black—averse to being crossed;
so it will be better for us to agree to go the same
road, rather than always be pulling contrary ways.
You will bear in mind what I said about our company
being made a refuge, and not repeat such a
mistake. I shall look in again after Christmas;
meantime, allow me to wish you the compliments of
the season.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Thank you; same to you, sir,” answered Mr.
Black, forced to accept the civility, but by no means
mollified by it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope the new year may prove a prosperous
one to us all,” said Mr. Stewart, meditatively, looking
into his hat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope so too,” the promoter agreed; “it shall
not be for want of any exertions on my part if the
company fail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fail,” repeated Mr. Stewart; “fail! it shall
not fail! Conducted with ordinary prudence, it
should be a perfect mine of wealth. There is
scarcely a public bakery in England which has not
paid the most enormous dividends; and what is the
field in any county or provincial town in comparison
to that which is open for us in London? Three
millions of bread-eaters, and not a large bakery to
supply them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may remember that I make a somewhat
similar observation in the prospectus,” remarked
Mr. Black, not sorry to have an opportunity of
indirectly accusing Mr. Stewart of plagiarism.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you? How very singular! Is it copyright?
If so, I will not infringe again. And that reminds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>me what induces you to stick the Mount Cashell
motto at the heads of each advertisement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose the motto was in existence before the
Mount Cashells were thought of,” retorted Mr.
Black. “It is none the worse for their having used
it, is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is none the better,” was the reply; “still,”
went on Mr. Stewart, “the prospectus, as a whole,
does you credit. It is very moderate in its tone—a
great matter in these days of bounce and swagger;
and that allusion to the ‘Give us bread and the
games’ is rather neat. I like the stamp motto also,
‘Sweet and wholesome.’ Altogether, that Latin of
yours is a good idea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The idea was mine, but not the Latin,” answered
Mr. Black, frankly. “I do not pretend to be much
of a scholar myself; I had something else to do
when I was young than pore over any book, unless,
indeed, it might be a day-book; but I know even
the appearance of learning has an effect on the
general public, and so I begged Dudley to look me
up one or two appropriate quotations. He is a
gentleman, you know—been to college, and all that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“They do not sell brains at college, it appears,
however, though they may learning,” remarked
Mr. Stewart, drily; after which speech, intended,
evidently, as a delicate compliment to Arthur
Dudley’s understanding, the great director put his
hat on his head, and said “Good afternoon” to
Mr. Black, and, walking out of the office, took his
way westward through Cloak and Trinity Lanes,
thinking as he went, “That is a sharp, clever fellow.
Now I wonder if he can and will be honest, even
to answer his own purpose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the subject of this speculation stood
shaking his clenched fist after Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish to God I dare have kicked the old
humbug up Cannon Street,” he said in his rage,
quite out loud. “I should not mind paying a
hundred pounds to have the pleasure of telling the
cursed upstart that I don’t care a damn for him,
or his connection, or his standing, or anything about
him. Here have I had all the trouble, all the
anxiety, all the work, while my gentleman was
amusing himself doing the grand in foreign countries;
and then, when I, after having stood the
racket, began to hope the rest would be smooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>sailing, down he comes with his capital, and sweeps
away all chance of profit. Capital, indeed; damn
capital, say I!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the man whose life had been one long
struggle to gain capital, who was never weary of
writing prospectus after prospectus in order to prove
that without capital nothing good or great ever had
been, or ever would be, accomplished; the ostensible
object of whose existence it was to demonstrate that
individual exertion was useless; that it was only the
united wealth of a number of individuals which
could hope to effect large results; the actual end of
whose labours—could those labours have been
carried out according to the programme he had
arranged—was to exterminate all small tradesmen,
all struggling merchants—almost unconsciously
paraphrased the sense of Mr. Raidsford’s lamentation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Great wits and little wits, we are assured, oftentimes
jump together, and on this occasion, certainly,
the man of large resources and the man of none
expressed nearly identical opinions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The concentration of capital will be the ruin of
England,” said Mr. Raidsford, who felt how such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>concentration might have neutralized his own efforts
to rise in the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Damn capital!” said Mr. Black, smarting under
Mr. Stewart’s insolence; “it is capital, and nothing
but capital, which enables these fellows to give
themselves such airs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the game is not finished yet,” added the
promoter, next instant; “when it is, Mr. Stewart,
you will perhaps find out to your cost which of us
rises the winner.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c009'>HOLLY BERRIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The accident at Berrie Down brought, during the
course of the few weeks preceding Christmas, an
unprecedented number of visitors to the Hollow.
Never before in the memory of any individual connected
with the establishment had so many carriages,
driven up to the door in the course of one day as
was the case when once news of Lally’s precarious
state came to be bruited abroad.</p>

<p class='c011'>People who had never called on Mrs. Dudley now
called to inquire after her child, and there had to be
a piece of cork fastened under the knocker, and
some baize tied round the clapper of the bell, in
order to prevent Heather being maddened by the
incessant rat-tat-tat and ting-ting-ting of her neighbours’
grand footmen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Very little social courtesy had been extended to
Mrs. Dudley since her marriage. Long before her
advent, the Dudleys had dropped off the visiting lists
of their more aristocratic acquaintances, and no one
felt much inclined to take steps towards reviving the
old intimacy when Arthur Dudley brought home to
the Hollow a wife of whom no one knew anything,
who might, in fact, be “anybody”—as Mrs. Poole
Seymour, the great lady of North Kemms, vaguely
expressed herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>When society does not take notice of a woman on
the occasion of her marriage, it is difficult for any
member composing it subsequently to repair that
omission; and thus, although there was scarcely a
lady in the three parishes who would not willingly
enough have extended her countenance to Mrs.
Dudley, and although most persons’ consciences
pricked them when they passed the Hollow, or met
the pretty woman and her children, and the brothers
and sisters-in-law whom she had so speedily tamed
and civilized, in Berrie Down Lane, still Heather’s
circle of acquaintances had remained extremely
limited, and might have remained so for many a
year longer, had not Lally’s accident broken the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>conventional ice, and brought, as I have said,
visitors and kind inquiries to Berrie Down in
abundance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The excitement produced by the little girl’s
illness and danger was, indeed, something astonishing.
Mothers had a fellow-feeling for the poor
creature who sat—so the doctor reported—day and
night by her little girl’s side. Those who were
childless had perhaps even a keener, because a more
imaginative and sentimental sympathy in the matter.
Gentlemen, as a rule, admired Heather, and regretted
that any trouble should fall upon her; and,
added to all these causes of compassion, there was a
strong feeling in the small community round about
Berrie Down that Mrs. Dudley was a victim—an
unappreciated victim, moreover; that she must have
had a hard time of it with those boys and girls, and
that “proud, useless husband,” and that it was quite
time somebody took her up and made her position
more endurable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The world’s pity is usually abundant in inverse
proportion to the necessity that exists for it to
be vouchsafed at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Certainly, Heather did not consider the five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>brothers and sisters a cause for repining, nor had she
ever murmured because she and her husband often
found it a hard struggle to make the two ends of
their income meet.</p>

<p class='c011'>If, of late, she had occasionally wept over any
paragraph in her life’s story, those tears were never
shed in public—of their bitterness she never complained
to any created being.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her happiness the world could not mar, her grief
the world could not cure; and, perhaps for both
these reasons, and also because she felt that society
was by no means an inexpensive luxury, she did not
respond to the advances now made with so much
alacrity as the ladies of the three parishes thought
she might have done under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Under the circumstances” meant, that, although
they—the ladies—had neglected Mrs. Dudley at
first, still they had availed themselves of the earliest
opportunity which offered of making amends to her
for their former want of attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were willing to forget all the years during
which the Dudleys had voluntarily put themselves
on one side, if the Dudleys would forget those
years likewise; but Heather did not, as has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>stated, appear unduly elated by the somewhat tardy
honour which was now sought to be thrust upon her.
It was not in her nature to be unthankful or ungracious;
but her mind was troubled about her child,
she said, and she trusted visitors would excuse her
coming down to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus Bessie Ormson and Agnes Dudley were in
the habit of repulsing great ladies day after day;
but, somehow, the autocrats of their various ilks did
not take these apologetic messages in bad part,—rather,
on the contrary, they professed their anxiety
that poor dear Mrs. Dudley should not leave her little
girl, and appeared quite content to hear the story
of the accident from the lips of other members of
Squire Dudley’s family.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hitherto, most decidedly, the younger Dudleys
had been rather a trouble to the minds of those
exalted persons who occasionally deigned to discuss
Berrie Down Hollow and the persons who dwelt there.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were regarded as a species of fungus which
had been permitted to grow upon and disfigure a
very old and a very good tree. Grandchildren
were they of an alderman—a poor alderman, be it
remembered, who had not even thought it worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>his while to recognise the honour birth had conferred
on him and his, by leaving a sufficient
amount of money behind to patch up the broken
fortunes of the Dudleys of Berrie Down.</p>

<p class='c011'>If trade were to be tolerated at all, it could only
be tolerated for the sake of the wealth it brought to
aristocratic, but empty coffers.</p>

<p class='c011'>In itself, like a servant, it was an evil; but like
a servant also, if it did its work, its presence might
be both tolerated and approved.</p>

<p class='c011'>If it failed to perform its appointed task—if it
grew poor and pretentious, like its betters, then the
sooner it was stamped out the better.</p>

<p class='c011'>A poor alderman seemed in the eyes of those
great people nothing more nor less than an arrant
impostor. Of course, any gentleman marrying the
daughter of such a person would conclude she had
money, and for her not to have money was a downright
deception.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then for her to have five children. “Those
kind of vulgar women always have tribes of children,
my dear,” said Mrs. Poole Seymour, who was
childless, to the Honourable Augusta Baldwin (Lord
Kemms’ aunt), who was popularly supposed never to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>have had an offer. “If poor Major Dudley had lived
much longer, there is no telling how many sons and
daughters might have been left for his heir to support.
Shocking I call it. You remember, the first
wife had only one child, and this present Mrs.
Dudley but two. Quite enough, to my mind—just
a nice number; but as for those five other creatures,
it is perfectly heartbreaking to think of any man
being burdened with them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the bird’s-eye view of the question which
society from an exalted position was good enough to
take.</p>

<p class='c011'>When, however, society condescended to a nearer
inspection, affairs assumed a somewhat different
aspect. The Dudley girls were not uncouth young
women, with large bones, rough hair, loud voices,
and red hands; rather they were, to borrow from
Mrs. Poole Seymour once more, decidedly pleasing
girls—very nice and unaffected in their manners, and
irreproachable as to their accent. Altogether, a call
at Berrie Down grew to be considered an agreeable
object for a morning drive. The ladies of the three
parishes were, perhaps, a trifle weary of each other,
and liked, moreover, having something to do.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Fruit and flowers, game, picture-books, dolls,
toys, came daily to the Hollow, together with compliments
and kind inquiries. Callers arrived also,
assured that some day Heather herself would become
visible, and also very certain that half an
hour at Berrie Down passed more rapidly than ten
minutes anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bessie did her best to amuse the great people,
and the great people were pleased to approve her
efforts. “You and your sisters, really must come
over and stay with me,” Mrs. Poole Seymour was
good enough at last to declare; and then Bessie had
to explain she was not a Miss Dudley at all,—only
a cousin wishful to help Mrs. Dudley at that
trying period. A “sort of nurse,” added Bessie,
mischievously, whereupon Agnes Dudley observed,
“A very pearl of nurses; I do not know what we
should have done without her;” at which little
speech Mrs. Poole Seymour smiled graciously, and
said they were good, sweet girls, of whom she trusted
she should yet have the pleasure of seeing a great
deal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has all the trust, and all the pleasure
on her side, then,” remarked Bessie, after their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>visitor departed; but, in spite of this depreciating
observation, there can be no question but that Miss
Ormson liked playing hostess—that she delighted
in trying her strength and testing her power on
grand ladies who were to the manner born, and
never seemed disturbed or put out by any circumstance,
or any person.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another thing pleased her also—the vain coquettish
puss—namely, to run up to her room after the
various callers had departed, and looking in the
glass consider how much prettier—how much more
graceful she was than any of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Crompton Raidsford was amongst the earliest
of Mrs. Dudley’s visitors. No one, not even the
Earl’s daughter, who married Mr. Plimpton, of
Thornfield—a man commonly believed to be rolling
in wealth—came in such style to Berrie Down as
the contractor’s wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had the shortest distance to drive of any lady
in the neighbourhood, yet she arrived in a great
chariot, drawn by a pair of horses, seventeen hands
high if they were an inch, with coachman and footman
on the box, and another footman behind.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Bessie subsequently remarked, “Anybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>might have thought the Lord Mayor of London had
come out in his state carriage to visit us. I really felt
quite subdued by such unnecessary magnificence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if you only saw Mrs. Raidsford, Heather,”
she went on; “if you could only imagine the mass
of satin, and velvet, and sable, and pretension and
vulgarity, which descended, assisted by two footmen,
from that chariot, you would be astonished
to think Mr. Raidsford has lived with her so long.
I never did behold such a woman. I dare not look
at Agnes while she was talking. Do you think
I could at first imagine whom she meant by ‘your
gentleman,’ or conceive why she wanted to know
what sized nursery you had? I consider it was
most clever of Agnes to interrupt me when I was
going to say I could get a rule from Cuthbert and
measure it for her. How came you to guess, Aggy,
that was her way of inquiring how many children
Heather had? She said she hoped you would not
think she had condescended in coming over so soon—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What!” exclaimed Heather in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She meant intruded, I believe,” explained
Bessie, “for that Mr. Raidsford had never given
her a moment’s peace about calling ever since he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>heard of the collusion your little girl had met with.
I may safely say,” proceeded Bessie, “that she did
not use a single long word in its right sense. She
informed us—talking of ghosts, that she was not
supercilious—that if we would come over to Moorlands
any day she would be very glad to show us
the apiary Mr. R. had built for British birds; that
her young ladies were not much of ones for pedestrian
exercise, that they preferred walking to riding,
only their ‘papar’ thought it was well for them to
be learned how to do it. She told us her nerves
never would have been strong enough for her to do
anything in that way; in fact, it always put her heart
in her mouth to see Lord Kemms a leaping of that
Black Knight of his over the fossil on the lawn. If
she mentioned Lord Kemms once during the time
she was here,” went on Bessie, “she did sixty
times. That is the worst of a man rising; he has
to carry his wife a dead weight, up with him. Well,
there must be some of her to be some of all sorts—so
let us rest and be thankful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Utterly astonished was Arthur at sight of the
visitors who came to inquire concerning the health
of his eldest born.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Leonard might have broken every bone in his
body before they would have offered any such
civility,” he grumbled; but Bessie bade him “hush—sh—sh—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was really your good child Leonard, Arthur,
who pushed her in,” she said; “and if we have
been wise enough to keep that fact in the background,
I pray you not to be ungrateful. It was
poor Heather’s sinner who fell into the water, but it
was your saint who was the cause of her doing so.
And it is natural such a catastrophe should bring
wives and mothers to Berrie Down. It brought me,
so you ought not to be surprised at anything after
that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was very kind of you, Bessie,” answered Squire
Dudley; but, nevertheless, he refused to see their
visitors, and it was long before the honours of
Berrie Down were done by Heather in person.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, indeed, Mrs. Poole Seymour, and the
Honourable Augusta Baldwin, Mrs. Plimpton, and
Mrs. Carroll, and Mrs. Raidsford, and Mrs. Lynford,
and Mrs. Hulst, and a multitude of other morning
callers, professed themselves charmed, and wondered
how it happened they could have resided for so long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>a time within visiting distance of Berrie Down without
knowing that dear, sweet, gentle Mrs. Dudley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything prettier than Mrs. Dudley and her little
girl,” opined society, “had never been exhibited at
the Royal Academy;” and, certainly, in those days,
both mother and child were very touching—Heather
pathetic, with pale thin face and anxious eyes; Lally
so easily tired, so soon wearied, even with fresh toys
and strange faces.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oo dood to Lally,” she said to Mrs. Poole
Seymour when that lady bought her a doll’s house
furnished complete, and would have had the child
play with and enjoy it; “oo dood to Lally, but
Lally tired mamma—tell lady—Lally’s very bad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was not a woman who went up in due
time to the room where Lally lay that left it with
dry eyes. Even Mrs. Raidsford declared the scene
was “quite effective.” As for Mrs. Poole Seymour,
she was never weary of bringing over toys for the
child, which the poor little creature always clutched
with weak avidity, and then next moment almost
wearily relinquished.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were two spirits in poor Lally then; the
spirit of health and the spirit of sickness, the spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of her former self, and the spirit which entered into
her body as she rose for the last time struggling for
life in the cold waters of Mr. Scrotter’s pond. The
first was all eagerness, excitement, vivacity; the
last was languid, weary, inactive; the first hastened
her pulses, sent the blood to her cheeks, loaded her
tongue with eager words, and tipped her fingers
with quicksilver; the second laid a depressing
weight on her heart, caused the unspoken words to
die away on her white lips, drew the bright colour
from her face, checked the impulses of the little
hands, and caused the tired head to be laid on her
mother’s breast almost before the new toys were
examined,—the latest wonder in doll creation
critically inspected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Put ’em away,” she was wont to say with the
air of a matron of forty, “put ’em away, Lally
look at ’em by-and-by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But by-and-by came and went,—came and went
without bringing much more inclination to Lally
to inspect her new possessions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The loveliest doll on earth could not have retained
her attention very long in the days of which I am
writing. She would look at it for a moment and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>then turn her eyes wearily away. “Lally not well,”
that was the burden of the song then; “Ma,—Lally
not well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you are better, my pet,” Heather was wont
to say. “You are not very bad now, Lally.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, but Lally not well;” and then mother and
doctor and friends would look at each other and
declare “she is much better, and the spring will do
wonders for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of that spring and of the summer Lally might
have been said to rave. Each morning when she
opened her eyes, she would ask between sleeping and
waking, “Bessie, are the leaves come yet?” or “are
the trees green? Is it spring now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense, puss,” Bessie always answered,
“Christmas has not come yet; you are to get well,
you know, and be carried downstairs to eat your
plum pudding. Little girls who sham sickness are
not to have any good things at all. You are to be
taken into the drawing-room and kissed under the
misletoe—kissed till you are black and blue, you bad
child, for all the trouble and anxiety you have
caused us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whereupon Lally would declare she “wadn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>bad tild, and she wouldn’t be tissed back and bue;
Lally has had more tisses than ze liked these days;
Lally tired of ladies tissing of her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You little ungrateful monkey!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Big fat ooman tissed Lally, and hurt her with
her beard,” the child complained, “and Lally did
not like her sweet-sweets; they were nasty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ought not to have had any, you know, you
dreadful child!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lally ought; Lally would like some this minute,
if they was dood, and not mortar. Issy said they
were mortar, and that Mrs. Aidsford had no business
to bring them: but Issy says wicked things,
and Lally isn’t to ’tend to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having finished which speech, Lilian Dudley
nestled her head in her pillow, and thought over her
various visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like to have Muff,” she said at last, as a
consolatory conclusion; and, accordingly, Muff was
brought; and from that day forth the cat rarely
left its little mistress’s side. By some mysterious
means, the creature seemed to understand there was
a terrible fight going on in the silent room, and it
would lie for hours quietly beside the child, purring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>vigorously, never moving, unless Lally said, tenderly,
“poor titty,” or “poor puss,” in which case
it would open its eyes and blink at her gratefully,
or else march backwards and forwards over her
breast, rubbing sides, and head, and tail against the
pinched, changed face of the little child.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was nothing much sadder, in those days,
than the contemplation of Lally and “pussens,” as
she styled her cat.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the meek, unassuming, yet intense
sympathy of the dumb creature, not unmixed, it
might be, with a perfect appreciation of the physical
comforts which Lally’s illness provided for her.
There was, on the other hand, the irritable and unreasonable
affection of the higher creature—the exacting
fondness of a mistress who expected Muff continually
to get up out of her sleep, to rub against
and make much of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Which Muff did—greatly to her credit, as I
consider.</p>

<p class='c011'>A dozen times in an hour the cat was roused
from her slumber, with invariably the same result;
and, sleepy or not sleepy, she was always expected,
if Lally wished that she should do so, to fold her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>paws, lie quiet, put down her head, commence purring,
and so wander into dreamland once again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor pussens, poor tittens, poor Muff!” and so
mistress and cat would fall to rest, mutually caressing
each other; and sometimes Bessie, watching
the pair, would turn her head aside and cry
silently.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were gathering holly berries in those days;
and Lally had longed to go out and watch the holly
being cut “in Berrie Down Lane, and just round
about, ma,” she said; but in this matter Heather was
firm. “My pet must not put her little face outside
the doors till spring comes,” she answered; and then
Lally very piteously asked, “Will spring be long,
ma,—will spring be long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at the beautiful dress I have made for
Lally’s own self,” said Bessie on Christmas-eve—holding
up a little frock of white cashmere, which
she had bound and trimmed, and decked out
prettily with light blue ribbon. “My child is to be
dressed up in all this loveliness to-night, and carried
down in Bessie’s arms, to say to mamma and papa
‘merry Christmas, happy new year.’ Lally won’t be
awake soon enough in the morning to say all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>long sentence. Would Lally like to be dressed,
and go now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lally conceiving that she would, the grand dress
was slipped on over her little night-gown, then a
soft blue shawl was thrown round her neck, and thus
attired, with her head resting on Bessie’s shoulder,
Lally put in her first appearance in the family circle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling, my darling!” Heather said; and
she stood up white and trembling as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that my little girl?” Arthur exclaimed, making
a movement to take her, in which he was restrained,
however, by Lally’s statement that she was not to be
hurt. “Lally’s been very sore, pa,” she explained.
“Merry Chris-mes, dood new year!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is not it,” whispered Bessie, giving her a
little admonitory shake,—“happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ma, happy Chris-mes, merry new year!” and
the little creature made the round of the family, not
forgetting Master Marsden, whom Bessie reluctantly
allowed to kiss her. Surreptitiously and remorsefully
that young gentleman conveyed into Lally’s hand
five or six marbles, which had been secreted about
his person.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are for you,” he whispered; and the gift
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Lally religiously carried upstairs, falling asleep with
the precious stones laid in a heap beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ver pret,” she said, pointing to the great branch
of holly, with its red berries glowing among the
glossy leaves, which Bessie had suspended over the
top of her little bed, “ver—pret.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, my darling, they are ver—ver pret,” answered
Bessie, while she took off Lally’s finery, and laid her
down among the snowy napery; and when all that
was done, and Lally was tucked up for the night,
Bessie took her seat beside the bed, and told the
child, as well as she could, what event the holly
berries were hung there to commemorate; told her
how, more than eighteen centuries before, the wise
men came to worship at Bethlehem, and how the
star had gone before them, and stood over the
manger where Jesus was laid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is why we hang our houses with holly
branches, Lally,” Bessie went on, “because to-morrow
is the birthday of One who loved us all
exceedingly. Do you understand me, pet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Iss,” was the reply, “Lally does; Lally heard
all that before long ago, that is why we have plum-pudden
too.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Rather disheartened at this view of the question,
Bessie observed, that when people were glad they
prepare a feast, and “make merry,” and that plum-pudding
happened to be part of the good things
provided at Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did He have dood tings?” Lally immediately
inquired, with the terrible perception of the incongruous,
which makes it so difficult to talk to children
on serious subjects in connection with their daily
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Altogether, it seemed to Bessie that she had
better have left her religious instruction alone; but
she had gone too far to recede, and accordingly she
answered that “He had been poorly lodged, poorly
fed, evilly treated while He remained on earth; that
though He had done so much for men, men had
used Him despitefully, and mocked and forsaken
Him. But He loved little children, Lally,” finished
Bessie, “and so, when you look at the holly berries,
you must always think of Him. He was so good,
Lally, that Child born eighteen hundred years ago.
He was so good!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you dood, Bessie?” asked the little
creature.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“No, my darling, I am not; I wish I were; oh!
Lally, I wish I were!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are dood to Lally,” was the encouraging
reply. “Bessie, I do love ’oo; thing to I, please;
thing I to thleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Bessie refused to sing at all till Lally said
“sleep” properly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seep dere den,” Lally exclaimed in a tone of such
triumph that Bessie was fain to kiss her a dozen
times ere commencing one of those dear old Christmas
carols that one never hears now-a-days, that went
out of fashion with the Christmas frosts and
snows.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the time the strain was ended, Lally had
fallen asleep; but through the night she wakened
and asked Agnes, who sat beside her bed, to tell her
more about the Child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What child, dear?” said Agnes, who thought
she was dreaming or wandering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is His birthday, you know; the Child;” and
then Agnes knew what she meant, and told her
stories about Him and His goodness till Lally said
plaintively, “I wis He was here now, Aggy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish He were, my darling, for He would make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>you better in a moment,” Agnes answered, sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Agnes!”—it was Heather coming into the
room with a loose dressing-gown thrown around her
that made Agnes turn at this point,—“He is here,
and He will make my child well, if it seemeth Him
good. I prayed for her all the time she was so
very ill, as it would have been impossible for me to
have prayed, had I not felt He was with me,
standing near; but I tried not to pray too much,
dear, lest in granting my petition He should punish
me for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so mother and aunt talked while the child
dropped off into slumber once again, and so the
Christmas morning dawned—fine, and clear, and
bright; and the holly berries looked red and warm
as the December sun peered through the windows
of the Hollow, and found everything there in due
order for a quiet, happy Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child was not well, but she was out of
danger, and Heather felt she must that day go to
church and thank God for delivering her darling from
the lions—for giving her back from the very jaws
of death, to life, and hope, to parents, and friends.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c009'>GONE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was a lovely morning, and every one was going
to walk over to Fifield church except Laura, who
had almost tearfully entreated to be left in charge of
Lally.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I love her as much as any of you,” she said,
“and still I have the least to do with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So it was settled that Laura should remain at
home, and all the rest proceed along Berrie Down
Lane,—up which we walked slowly and lingeringly
in the first chapter in this book—to Fifield.</p>

<p class='c011'>A large party—for, although the intended festivities
had been given up, and no visitors were
invited to Berrie Down Hollow, still, the Dudleys
themselves made a goodly number—eight, including
Bessie—who looked pale and tired when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>she came into the drawing-room, “dressed in all
her best;” so shrieked Harry Marsden—and ready
to go to church.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mayn’t I go too?” asked that young gentleman,
pulling at Heather’s dress; “I’d like the walk as
well as anybody.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think it is only for the sake of the walk
we are going to church, Harry?” asked Agnes,
virtuously drawing on her gloves as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How should I know? Bessie’s likely going for
the sake of the young men; that’s what pa says takes
all girls to church,” answered the <i><span lang="ca">enfant terrible</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I daresay Mrs. Dudley will not object to
your seeing whether that is what we go for,” said
Bessie. “I will brush your hair and put you to
rights, for you are a perfect scarecrow now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And thus it was settled Master Marsden should
accompany the party; and Alick, home for Christmas,
had not a chance given him of looking at Agnes
to see how she took Harry’s remark about the object
for which young ladies went to church.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What had taken her to North Kemms,” he wondered;
“whom could the man be they had met
there? what his connection with Bessie?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>These questions Alick stood striving vainly to
answer, while Master Marsden was being brushed
and made look respectable by Bessie Ormson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am as good as a mother to you, Harry,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure you are; but that’s not saying much,”
answered the boy. “Mine has always a headache,
and is constantly telling us not to make a noise.
Noise, indeed! Women can make enough noise
themselves, when they want to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not say ‘want to,’ Harry, it is vulgar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No more vulgar than you are,” he replied. “I
shall talk as I like. What is good enough for pa
ought to be good enough for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a fortunate thing for both of us that I am
not your pa, as you call him,” Bessie answered, “for
I should shake you to death some day. Now, are
you ready, or are you going to keep us waiting all
day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You think you look so nice in that bonnet,”
Harry sneered, “that you want to be off like a flash
of lightning. You are none so pretty, some people
think, though Harcourt, as my papa says, does
imagine there is nobody like you. Pa says he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>would not marry you. I heard pa tell ma so, not
a week before I came here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t wonder at that,” Bessie replied; “your
papa probably finds he has married one too many of
the family already.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But this side stroke Master Marsden seemed
unable perfectly to understand; wherefore he asked
Bessie what she meant; in reply to which question
he received the information that “children should
not ask too many questions; and that, if he intended
going with them to Fifield church, it was time he
got his cap and went downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In acknowledgment of all this instruction, Harry,
pulling a face at Bessie, that young lady forthwith unceremoniously
marched him off and gave him in charge
of Cuthbert, who grumbled a little over the trust.</p>

<p class='c011'>Human nature is much the same on Christmas
as on any other day in the week, and every creature
in Berrie Down—Heather herself not excepted—felt
Harry Marsden to be a burden and a tax.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never before—never, Heather thought, had
Berrie Down Lane looked so lovely as it did on that
morning when they all paced it side by side. She
had not been out for weeks previously, and the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>branches of the trees seemed to bend and greet her
as she passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were few leaves, and there were no wild
flowers, yet the banks and hedgerows looked warm
and pleasant, the ivy was trailing over the sward
and twining fresh and green round the roots of the
elms and beeches; the spruce laurel put forth
its glossy foliage between the bare boughs of the
thorn, and its bluish-black berries formed a contrast
to those of the holly, red and glowing in the
sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything looked fair and lovely to Heather on
that Christmas morning. Arthur had been so kind
to her for weeks past, had never grumbled about
Lally’s illness, nor complained concerning the child
having occupied too much of her time and thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick was back amongst them—not much changed
by his sojourn in town—good, and considerate, and
helpful as ever. He talked hopefully of a vacant
situation in Messrs. Elser’s office, which he thought
Cuthbert might fill; and Heather’s secret desire for
many a day previously had been that when Cuthbert
went forth into the world it might be under Alick’s
auspices.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>She did not feel quite so certain of the one boy
as of the other; she did not think that as Cuthbert
grew up she could manage him without Alick’s aid.
He was more uncertain in his temper, less to be
depended on in any way, weaker for good, stronger
for evil than his brother. Altogether, Heather
desired that Alick should have the supervision of him;
and, behold, there was already a chance of the desire
being gratified.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Lally was better; though not yet strong,
she was certainly better, and the girls were well;
even Bessie made no complaint, though Heather
thought she looked a trifle pale in her pretty bonnet,
made of violet velvet, which was about the most
becoming colour and material possible to the complexion
of that young belle, Miss Ormson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a shame, dear, that Gilbert is not with us,”
Heather had laughingly said the same morning,
standing under the misletoe. “Let me kiss you for
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kiss me for yourself, Heather,” Bessie answered,
colouring up to her very temples, “but not for
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why not for him?” asked Heather.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“I will tell you to-morrow, not to-day,” was the
reply. “To-morrow, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, irresistibly, there came back to Heather’s
mind that passage in “Elizabeth, or the Exiles of
Siberia,” where Elizabeth, repeating the word “to-morrow,”
sighs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You look pale, Bessie,” Heather remarked, when
they had almost reached the foot of Berrie Down
Lane. “Are you getting tired, dear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not feel very well,” Bessie answered; “I
think I will go back again, if you have no objection.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately, every one offered to return with her,
even Harry Marsden, who, being debarred from
throwing stones at the birds, was beginning to feel
weary of the walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not mind going to church.” “Let me walk
back with you.” “No, I will go.” “No, you
have not been out for ever so long.” “Let me”—“me”—“me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All of which polite offers Bessie declined, saying,
“if any one insisted on returning with her, she should
walk on to church.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not ill,” she finished, “I am only tired;
when I get home, I shall lie down and be as bright by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the time you come back as any of you. Good-bye,—<i><span lang="fr">au revoir</span></i>!”—and
with that she kissed her hand,
and commenced slowly retracing her steps—Heather
turning every now and then to watch her progress.</p>

<p class='c011'>The farther the distance between them became,
the silenter grew Heather. She felt a nameless
anxiety about Bessie,—an anxiety which she could
neither conquer nor analyze, but which, nevertheless,
increased until when, almost within sight of Fifield
church, she remarked to her husband that she
really thought she must return home also.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am uneasy about Bessie,” she said; “the girl
certainly did not look well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh!” exclaimed Arthur, “she is only a little
tired. It would vex her if you went home now; I
should not think of doing such a thing, I really
should not, Heather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so Heather was persuaded not to follow
after Bessie, but go on to church.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will find her well enough on our return,”
remarked Arthur; and his prophecy proved correct,
for Bessie met them at the gate looking bright and
happy, and with as rich a colour as she had ever
boasted mantling in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Hollo! you’ve been painting,” cried out Master
Marsden. “Hasn’t she, Alick? nobody’s face was
ever like that, without paint.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Harry, I really shall have to write to your
mamma if you make such rude remarks,” said
Heather, rebukingly. “And so,” she added, addressing
Bessie, “you do feel quite well again? I
felt so uneasy after you left us that I should have
turned, had it not been for Arthur’s remonstrance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad he did remonstrate,” answered
Bessie, “it would have been a real grief to me if
you had come home on my account. I felt a little
tired, that was all, and I am quite rested now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, indeed, it seemed, for never had Bessie been
so gay as on that Christmas afternoon. And she
was very sweet too, as well as gay; she uttered no
sharp speeches; she was ready to play at cat’s-cradle
with Leonard, and even refrained from scolding
when Harry Marsden, who must needs take a hand
in that scientific game also, tore her lace sleeve to
shreds.</p>

<p class='c011'>She made herself agreeable to Arthur likewise,
talking to him, while Heather was upstairs, concerning
London, and her father’s business, and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>father’s anxieties, and the Squire’s own prospects,
as quietly and sensibly, her cousin subsequently declared,
as her mother might have done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I think, Heather, she must be very fond
of her father,” Arthur informed his wife; “for once
when she was speaking about him, and how hard he
worked, and of how little help her brothers were to
him, her voice quite shook, and the tears came into
her eyes. I had not given Bessie credit for so much
feeling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is a dear, sweet girl,” Heather answered.
“I am glad she did not insist, as I feared she might,
on sitting up with Lally. She is completely worn
out, I think. Did you notice how pale she turned
when she was bidding us good-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Other people beside Heather had observed this
pallor. Mrs. Piggott, who, making a grievous complaint
concerning Priscilla Dobbin’s shortcomings
and habit of always being out of the way when
wanted, was silenced by the sight of Bessie’s wan
face, and by Bessie’s entreaty for her not to be hard
on Priscilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was with me a long time, you know, Mrs.
Piggott, to-day,” she said; “I did not feel very well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>when I returned this morning, and Prissy put away
my bonnet, and did a few other things for me that I
was not inclined to do for myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, there, Miss, don’t say another word, but
go away to bed; you look like a ghost this minute;
you have been trying to kill yourself lately, that is my
opinion; but, please God, we will all turn round now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where shall we turn to, Mrs. Piggott?” asked
Bessie, with a smile, and then she re-crossed the hall
and ascended the stairs to her own room, only
pausing for a moment ere she went, to ask Alick if
he would take a letter up to town for her on the
following morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is to papa, and he will receive it earlier if
you post it in London. Thank you. I will leave it
on the hall table to-night. Good-bye, Alick, good-bye!”
and Alick imagined she pressed his hand
tighter than ever she had done before, and that
there was a very plaintive tone in her voice as she
uttered that word, “Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Later on in the night, when every one except
Lucy Dudley, who sat up with Lally, was supposed
to be in bed, Bessie stole into the nursery, “to have
another peep at her child,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“You ought to have been asleep long ago,” Lucy
remarked, rebukingly; but Bessie explained she had
been writing to her father a very long letter on an
important subject, which Alick was going to take to
town with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“About your marriage?” Lucy inquired, and
Bessie answered, “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If we talk any more, we shall waken Lally,”
the girl added. “Good-night, Lucy—good-night,
my bad child—my poor little Lally!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And stooping, she put her lips to Lally’s hand,
which lay outside the coverlet, and kissed it softly.
When she lifted her head, Lucy saw that her eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bessie, Bessie, darling, what is the matter?” she
whispered, putting her arms round her cousin’s
neck, and striving to detain her; but Bessie
gently disengaged herself from the embrace, and
saying, “we shall waken Lally; there is nothing
the matter with me,” left the room—her face
buried in her handkerchief, sobbing, sobbing as
she went. Lucy would have followed her, but
Bessie motioned her not to do so. Then, gliding
noiselessly along the passage, she entered her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>own room, and Agnes heard the key turned in
the lock.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some hours afterwards, when Heather, as was her
custom, came to relieve the watcher, Lucy expressed
her fear that Bessie could not be well. “She cried
so bitterly,” the girl explained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hearing this, Mrs. Dudley went to Bessie’s door,
and quietly turned the handle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Contrary to her expectations, the bolt was not
drawn inside, and she stepped into the apartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the darkness she stood, holding her breath and
listening. Bessie was asleep. Heather heard the
regular respiration of what she considered sound
slumber, and felt satisfied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not imagine she can be ill,” Mrs. Dudley
remarked, on her return to Lucy. “She is sleeping
quietly enough now, at all events. Tell me, dear,”
she added, “have you heard any noise at all during
the night? I fancied I caught a sound something
like footsteps crunching on the gravel, and got up
to see. Arthur said it was all my fancy. Did
you hear anything?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” Lucy replied, “nothing whatever. Bessie
was downstairs again, you know, leaving out that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>letter for Alick to take to town; but she was very
quiet. I do not think you could have heard her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was my fancy, I suppose,” remarked Heather.
“I have felt restless and nervous all the night long.
I was quite glad when four o’clock struck to get up.
Now, go to bed, Lucy, or you will feel ill for want of
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No likelihood of that,” Lucy answered, suppressing
a yawn, however, as she spoke, and went
off, leaving mother and child alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sitting there quite alone with her little girl, the
restlessness of which Heather had complained returned
upon her with double force. She tried to
read; she fetched her work-basket, and commenced
sewing; she went and stood by the window looking
out into the darkness, and longed for five o’clock,
when there would come some sounds of life about the
house. It was a still, cold morning, pitch dark.
Not a dog barked—not a leaf stirred. The silence
was almost insupportable, and Heather felt it to be
so, as she left the window and returned to Lally’s
side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, the child slept quietly; and now Heather’s
thoughts reverted to Bessie. What could be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>matter with the girl? Why had she been crying
the previous night? Why did she so persistently
ignore Mr. Harcourt’s very existence? How did it
happen that the time for her marriage seemed no
nearer now than it had done in the summer?</p>

<p class='c011'>That Mr. Harcourt was a devoted correspondent,
Heather knew by the evidence of her own eyes.
Scarcely a morning passed without the post-bag
bringing a long epistle from him to his affianced
wife. Bessie’s acknowledgments of these epistles
were despatched at much longer and more uncertain
intervals; but then Bessie did not profess to
be a good correspondent. “She hated letter-writing
and letter-writers,” she openly declared; so that her
negligence in this particular proved nothing. Besides,
her time had been much occupied with Lally,
and altogether——</p>

<p class='c011'>As she reached this point in her mental argument,
Mrs. Dudley heard a sound as though a door
were being softly opened and closed at the end of
the corridor. With that nervous fear upon her,
which seems so often the advance courier of some
disaster, the messenger spurring on to tell us of the
approach of misfortune, Heather went out into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>passage and listened. Yes, there was some one
moving stealthily and cautiously in the direction of
the back staircase—a woman, for Mrs. Dudley could
hear the skirt of her dress brushing against the wall
as she stole along.</p>

<p class='c011'>It could not be any of the servants, because they
had no business in that part of the house;—their
sleeping-rooms being in the roof, and access to those
apartments only possible by means of the back
staircase which opened out of the front kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a door of communication, however,
between the long south corridor, where the principal
bedchambers were situated, and the other portion of
the house; and this door Heather now heard close
softly, as the first had done.</p>

<p class='c011'>Satisfied that Bessie must be ill and about to seek
Mrs. Piggott’s apartment, Heather hurried after;
but when she came to try to open the door, it
resisted all her efforts. As a rule, the key remained
on the side next the main staircase. Now, Heather
found it had been removed, and the door locked
from within. Not knowing what all this could
mean, she went back to Lally’s room, took a candle,
and, descending into the hall, made her way along a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>passage which led in the direction of the offices.
Crossing the front kitchen, she opened the door
which led towards the back staircase, and there on
the last step stood Priscilla Dobbin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing? where are you going?”
asked her mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was coming down to look at the clock, ma’am,”
answered the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have just left Miss Ormson’s room—is she
ill?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ma’am, not as I know of. She told me
last night to go to her room when I got up for a
letter for Master Alick to take to town.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And where is that letter?” asked Mrs. Dudley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the hall table, ma’am, I believe. Miss
Bessie left it there herself after she had wrote it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What made you lock the passage-door after you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Bessie told me to, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather could not understand the matter at all.
She did not believe that there was a sentence of
truth in the girl’s statement; but what her object
might be in speaking falsely, she was unable to
imagine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Ormson is awake, then?” she said, at length.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Yes, ma’am—leastways she was when I saw
her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Without another word, Mrs. Dudley turned to
regain the hall. She wanted to see if the letter
were really on the slab, and then she meant to go to
Bessie’s room and ascertain whether or not Priscilla
had spoken falsely.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole thing baffled Heather. But for the
locking of the door, she should have thought nothing
more about the matter; but what object either
Bessie or Priscilla could have in thus cutting off
immediate communication between the two parts of
the house, she was quite unable to divine.</p>

<p class='c011'>There on the slab lay Bessie’s letter—a thick
letter, for Heather lifted and held it in her hand
for a moment; then she laid it down again, and
ascended the front staircase, slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had not reached the landing, however, before
Priscilla was beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ma’am—Mrs. Dudley,” began the girl, “you
can turn me out of the house this moment, if you
like. I told you a lie about that letter. I did not
go to Miss Bessie’s room for it. Miss Bessie is
gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Gone!” Heather looked at the girl, and blankly
repeated that word after her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am; and there is a letter for you,
please, on the toilet-table,” at which point in her
confession Prissy began to whimper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t do that,” said Mrs. Dudley, almost
angrily. “Go on before me to Miss Ormson’s
room, and be quiet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus ordered, Priscilla walked along the passage,
and, opening the door of Bessie’s bedchamber, stood
aside to allow Mrs. Dudley to enter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather, as she did so, glanced hurriedly round
the apartment. There was no disorder, no confusion;
everything looked precisely as it might have
done, had Bessie been there—only Bessie was not
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather went up to the bed, and put her hand on
the sheet. It felt warm, and she turned to Priscilla,
saying, interrogatively—</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has only just left the house?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She went at one o’clock, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible! I have been in the room myself
since four o’clock, and she was sleeping then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was me, ma’am; and I was not asleep. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>heard you come in—I never went to sleep all night.
I’d have given anything, ma’am, if I might have
told you. I never was so miserable in all my life—and
poor Miss Bessie, she were a-crying dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is she gone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is she gone with?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That gentleman as is so sweet on her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t mean Mr. Harcourt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’! no, ma’am; that other what she came back
from church to meet yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Utterly bewildered, Heather stood in the middle
of the room, confounded and almost stupified.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had any one come to her and said Bessie was
dead, she could not have felt more shocked—more
grieved. Under her eyes this thing had been going
on—this deception from day to day, and from week
to week—and she had never even suspected its
existence. Her very servant had been cognisant
of it; this girl, this false, cheating, untruthful Prissy
Dobbin, had been persuaded by Bessie to conceal the
mischief until it was too late to repair it. And
Bessie, too, that bright, gay, affectionate creature,
was but a hypocrite and a deceiver! Mrs. Dudley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>felt this to be the last drop in the cup, and, covering
her face, wept bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t ’ee, ma’am,” implored Priscilla, “don’t
’ee take on so! Read what Miss Bessie says, mayhap
that ’ill tell you where she’s gone. The gentleman
worships the very ground she treads on; and
they would have told you, only something about his
father, I don’t rightly know what, prevented them.
Miss Bessie prayed and begged him yesterday to
let her speak to you. He wanted her, right or wrong,
to go off with him then, but she wouldn’t; she said
she wouldn’t spoil your Christmas Day, not for fifty
husbands—she did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were very fond of Miss Bessie?” Mrs.
Dudley said, inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Main fond, ma’am,” answered the girl. “I took
to her from the day she talked to me in the field,
and give I that harf a crown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then don’t go chattering about her having gone
off with any one, Prissy. If you are fond of her,
show your fondness by keeping silence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with that, Mrs. Dudley, first bidding Prissy
stay with Lally, in case she wakened, went and
roused her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Arthur,” she said, “Bessie is off—she has
eloped. What are we to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bessie eloped—Bessie off! Heather, you must
be dreaming!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I were,” answered his wife. “Is there
any use in trying to follow her, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There might be, if we knew where she was
gone,” Arthur replied. “What does she say in
her letter?” he added, noticing the paper in his
wife’s hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She does not give a clue,” said Heather. “She
merely states she is gone to be married, and that,
whenever her husband allows her, she will write
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better call up Alick,” suggested Arthur; and,
accordingly, Alick was called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They have four hours’ start,” said the young
man, practically, when he had heard Heather’s story,
“and their plans must have been well laid. I will
follow if you like, but I think it is useless. They
are in London by this time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What makes you think they have gone to
London?” asked Heather.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because it is the only place in which to be lost,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>answered the youth. And the three stood and
looked at each other for a few moments in utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>A great blow had suddenly fallen on them, and
they felt stunned with its force.</p>

<p class='c011'>That such a thing should have happened there!
that they should all have bidden each other good-night,
without a suspicion of coming evil—and that
this should have come to pass before morning!</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Mr. Harcourt, too—what will he say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he be a wise man, ‘that he is well rid of
her,’” answered Arthur. “She must be a bad girl—a
bad, false girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, oh! so good to Lally,” said Heather,
deprecatingly; “and I do not think it was of her
own free will she went now—I do not—I believe
she was driven to it. Read her letter, Arthur—read
how she says she tried to like Mr. Harcourt, and
how her mother forced her on. If I only knew she
were married, I could rest satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so husband and wife talked on, while Alick,
standing by, remained resolutely silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would tell nothing about it; he would say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>nothing concerning the stranger they had met at
North Kemms; he would not utterly destroy
Heather’s faith, and show her that Bessie had been a
deceiver from the beginning. His heart was yearning
after the girl, but he would not speak a word that
could give a clue as to whom she had eloped with.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had prayed him not to tell Heather, and he
would be faithful to his trust. From him Heather
never should know how false this girl had been—this
girl with the lovely face, and the sweet, winning
manners, which had gained her so many friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The matter should be kept quiet;” each attributing
different meanings to that expression,
agreed as to the expediency of this course. Arthur
said he would go to town with Alick, and take
Bessie’s letter on to her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, Mr. Ormson can do whatever he thinks
best,” said the Squire; and Heather at once went to
see that breakfast was got ready for the brothers
before their departure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder who the devil she can have picked
up,” remarked Squire Dudley, when his wife left the
room; “you never saw anybody hanging about the
place, did you, Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Very truthfully, Alick answered that he had not;
but still in his own soul he felt satisfied Bessie had
gone off with the stranger, who sat in the same pew
with them, and restored Miss Ormson’s prayer-book
on that Sunday when he and his cousin walked
across the fields to North Kemms church, talking
as they went.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c009'>MR. STEWART’S PROPOSAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The woman who would rule her household well, had
need to be endowed by Heaven with almost every
virtue. She should be quick to perceive and slow
to act; not given to rash judgments, nor easily moved
to anger. She should be patient and long-suffering.
She should remember that she is an absolute autocrat
in her small domain, and be merciful accordingly.
Her servants are but after all as children,
who have no claim to a parent’s care and affection.
She can take the bread out of their mouths, and, if
they have been happy with her, drive them forth
from Eden into the cold bleak world which is all
before them; she can make or mar their futures;
she can be lenient, or she can be harsh. She can
be cruel—like the servant who, going out loosed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>from his lord’s presence, seized upon his fellow-servant,
crying, “Pay me that thou owest;” or she
can have compassion on their infirmities, remembering
that the God of the whole earth has had
compassion on her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She can be hard and exacting, demanding full
measure and strict change; she can hold the scales
steadily, and if there be a feather’s weight too little,
cast them out; or she may be merciful as her Father
in Heaven is merciful, and be very patient towards
those who try her patience, and her temper, and
her Christianity daily. She can be the model,
managing, worldly mistress, or she may be the
mistress which the Lord shall approve when He
cometh to His kingdom. She can resolve the whole
question into one of work and wage, or she can go
further, and strive so to rule herself, and those she
has under her, that when the long account comes to
be made up—that account between rich and poor,
which will never be closed till eternity—the Great
Judge shall say she has done her feeble best, that
although only one talent was given unto her, it was
not buried in the ground, but put out to usury, returning
ample interest.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>So far, this story has, been written in vain, if any
reader have failed to comprehend that Heather
Dudley was one of those women, “the eyes of whose
maidens turned unto her;” and it will, therefore,
readily be conceived, that although many persons
would have incontinently turned Priscilla Dobbin
out of the house, and refused to sleep another night
under the same roof with such a double-faced, artful
little minx, Mrs. Dudley felt sorry for the girl and
inclined to make allowances.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had loved Bessie greatly, and she was but
young. Her life was all before her, and Heather could
not reconcile it to her conscience to mar it at the outset.
She had her talk with the girl, during the course
of which Prissy was, after the manner of her class,
silent, and apparently sulky. Nevertheless, she departed
from the audience-chamber red around the
nose, watery about her eyes, and generally depressed
in her spirits.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had thought Miss Bessie’s elopement a fine
thing till “it came to the bit,” thus she expressed
herself; but when they mutually had that bit between
their teeth she did not much relish the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was to take me as her maid, mum,” Priscilla
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>informed Heather; “but he would not let her.
He said she could send for me afterwards; but now,
ma’am, if you’ll let me stay with you, I would
rather. I’ll never even think about leaving you
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This piece of information was imparted some
weeks subsequently; during the course of those
weeks, nothing had been heard of or from Bessie.
Where she was gone, with whom she was gone off,
remained as great enigmas to the family at the
Hollow, as they did to her friends in town. From
Priscilla, indeed, Heather gathered that the cavalier
was tall, dark, handsome, and liberal; but this was
but a poor clue with which to start on a search after
Bessie, and so no one attempted to follow it.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had chosen her own course, and her place
knew her no more. All in vain, Heather looked for
a letter each morning—no letter ever came. All in
vain, Lally fretted after Bessie, and stretched out
her arms for the pretty cousin who was gone no
one knew where. Mr. Ormson advertised daily in
the <cite>Times</cite> to B—ss—e O——n, without ever receiving
a ghost of a reply. Mr. Harcourt paid
“private inquiry fees,” but still nothing came of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>his searching. Mrs. Ormson, figuratively, washed her
hands of Bessie, and scored her name out of the
family Bible—a volume she never opened except upon
high and rare occasions; the poor father watched
his opportunity, and wrote the name in again, the
first time Mrs. Ormson left her keys in the door
of the cupboard where she kept this tell-tale volume
of dates and ages. Dr. Marsden said he had always
expected something of the kind, and Heather almost
began to hate this strange man who came in as
chorus to every misfortune of the family.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew she never would marry Harcourt,”
affirmed this clever practitioner, the first time he and
Mrs. Dudley met after the occurrence; “the fellow
must have been a fool to believe her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why did you not think she would marry
him?” asked Heather, meekly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! her head was always running on a very
different kind of husband to a struggling lawyer;
and I only hope it is a husband she has got, and
not a lover, who will be packing her home to be a
disgrace and burden to her family some of these fine
days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should not think Bessie very likely to return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>to her family, whether she be married or not,”
Heather answered, a little bitterly. She could not
help being a trifle short with Dr. Marsden, whose
first-born was still at Berrie Down, a very thorn in
the flesh of every member composing the household.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never out of mischief, never still, always teasing,
eternally prying about, listening and meddling,
even Heather at last declared, if she only had the
money to spare, she would rather pay for Harry’s
education than be tormented with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there was an end coming to all such torments
and discomforts—an end which found Heather but
poorly prepared for its advent; and the beginning
of this end was a visit Arthur received on the 2nd
of January, from a tall, thin, grey-haired, hard-featured
individual, who sent in his card as—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Allan Stewart,”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Being at Kemms Park,” he stated, after the
first civilities had been gone through, “I thought
you would excuse my calling, and talking over a
little matter of business with you. It is about that
house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields; you know, Mr.
Dudley, we cannot purchase it from you. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>very sorry indeed, but such a thing is quite out of
the question.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why?” Arthur demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, in the first place, the position is anything
but desirable; and, in the second, the price you ask
is prohibitory. Besides, what do we want with purchasing
properties? we need only rent offices. It
would be the merest waste of money for us to do
otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Black assured me there was not the slightest
doubt of the Company purchasing my lease,”
answered Squire Dudley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, because Mr. Black thought the management
was going to be left entirely to him,” was the
reply. “Mr. Black now finds he was a little mistaken,
and that, being mistaken, he led you astray.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was the originator of the Company, or else
I have been greatly misinformed,” said Arthur,
defiantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have not been misinformed,” Mr. Stewart
answered; “but the originator of a company does
not necessarily mean the proprietor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Squire Dudley remained silent, digesting this piece
of knowledge, while Mr. Stewart proceeded—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“We directors are not necessarily his puppets because
he brought us together. Although he obtained
our names, and qualified us to act on the board, he
did not thereby obtain dominion over us, body and
soul for ever. Evidently, Mr. Dudley, you are
not a man of business, and you do not understand
much about commercial matters—indeed, Mr. Black
implied that fact to me; therefore, as I happened
to be staying with Miss Baldwin, I thought I would
walk over, and have a little friendly conversation
with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mean,” asked Mr. Dudley, harking back
to the original question, “that you absolutely refuse
to purchase these premises in Lincoln’s Inn Fields?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is my meaning,” was the reply; “if you
press the matter, of course it will be brought before
the board, Mr. Black, probably, acting as your
mouthpiece; but if you take my advice, you will not
press the point, nor have it brought before the board;
for I tell you fairly, the line must be drawn somewhere,
and at that point I mean it to be marked
broadly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not the proprietor of the Company, are
you?” asked Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“No; but I am the largest shareholder and
the most influential man on the board,” was the
reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what do you think of the scheme?” inquired
Arthur, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think the scheme a good one, if it be not
swamped; if the capital be not all jobbed away on
such purchases, for instance, as this house of yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you imply that I——,” began the Squire;
but Mr. Stewart cut across his sentence with—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I imply nothing; all I would suggest is, that
as at Mr. Black’s instance you bought a very
bad bargain, you should not seek to foist that
bargain at a profit on your own Company, but
wait patiently for dividends, and be thankful for
any profit on your shares the Lord may in due time
send you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know, sir,” asked Arthur, “that my
money has advertised this Company?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Black said something of the kind,” answered
Mr. Stewart; “and what he said, I am very sorry
to hear confirmed by you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have sold my crops, I have sold my stock, I
have accepted bills, all on the faith of making my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>fortune out of this bread affair. Mr. Black declared
I could get my money back three times over by
buying from time to time such properties as he
might advise—shops, mills, and so forth. He assured
me he could and would guarantee the Company
purchasing them from me on the most favourable
terms. He mentioned to me the names of
several individuals who have all made large fortunes
in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know many men, as you say, who have
obtained their money by jobbing,” was the calm
answer; “but they should not have got fat so soon
had I been on the direction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is rather hard upon me, though, to be made
your scapegoat,” said Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps so,” agreed Mr. Stewart; “but you
know the innocent often suffer for the guilty. In
fact, the scapegoat of which you have just spoken
had not, so far as I am aware, committed any sin
that should have doomed him to go unto a land not
inhabited. He was selected impartially by lot,
and then had to bear the iniquities of the children
of Israel. You, Mr. Dudley, are chosen by accident
to bear by proxy Mr. Black’s sins of over-appropriation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>He has already had quite as many pickings
for himself as any company can bear, and we cannot
now tolerate his beginning to pick for his friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your object in coming to tell me all this,
Mr. Stewart?” demanded Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, he is not quite an idiot,” reflected that
gentleman, while he answered aloud—“My object
is <i><span lang="fr">bona fide</span></i>; I want to benefit you and myself also.
I wish to explain exactly what I will and what I will
not do. To begin with the last. I will not agree
to the purchase of those premises in Lincoln’s Inn,
but I shall not oppose the Company renting them
from year to year; and, if you like to resign your
directorship, I will see that you are appointed secretary
at a commencing salary of one thousand pounds
per annum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What has the secretary to do?” asked Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very little, except remain honest,” was the
reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why do you wish me to be secretary?”
he further demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I think we may depend upon you;
because I know we could not depend on the secretary
nominated by Mr. Black. In matters of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>kind it does not do to stand too much upon ceremony.
Am I wrong, Mr. Dudley, in supposing a
thousand a year would prove an agreeable addition
to your income?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not aware, sir,” answered Arthur, in a
moment all in a flame with anger, “that I have, in
the course of our conversation, led you to believe
I am short of money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a difference between being short of
money and desiring more money,” answered Mr.
Stewart, calmly. “I concluded that, if you were a
perfectly satisfied man, you would have rested content
among your herds and flocks, and not sought to
increase your store in the City. I thought I would
come and talk this affair over with you before our
next meeting; but if my doing so has assumed the
character of an intrusion, I can only apologise and
withdraw.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having concluded which speech, Mr. Stewart rose
from his chair, and, bowing to Arthur, would have left
the room, had his host not entreated him to remain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am almost mad, I think,” said the Squire,
putting his hand to his forehead. “Excuse me if
I seemed rude. I do not believe I knew what I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>saying. It is a desperate experiment, Mr. Stewart,
for a man who knows nothing whatever of business
to allow himself to be drawn into it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered the director, coolly; “and it is
in the interests of such men that I decline permitting
this Company to be made a job, for the advancement
and enriching of the few at the expense
of the many. In my opinion, you have acted foolishly
in advancing large sums of money to Mr. Black;
but it is to Mr. Black you should look for repayment,
not to the shareholders.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur made no reply. He sat with his head
bent forward thinking to himself, “what a cursed
idiot I have been!” This was the first check he
had met with, and he bore it with proportionate
impatience. When a man has grown used to disappointment
and reverses; when he has met with a
long series of losses and failures; when his temper
has become, after a fashion, macadamized, and his
spirit broken under the wheels of constantly passing
hearses containing the bodies of his hopes, his
certainties, his ambitious aspirings; then the
sharp pang which was once so impossible to endure,
is dulled to a kind of quiet aching. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>pain wears itself out as the months and the years go
by; and he who once chafed, grows apathetic; and
she who formerly wept, now smiles and bears in
silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Arthur Dudley’s pain was fresh, and it had,
moreover, come sharply and suddenly upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had been stricken unprepared, and, though
the wound inflicted might not be very severe, still it
smarted as much as though his life had been placed
in jeopardy.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this Mr. Stewart observed and noted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That man has (for him) played high,” he thought,
“and staked not merely money but hope on the
game;” then finding Arthur still resolutely kept
silence, he proceeded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Black will altogether make a handsome
thing out of this Company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and he promised to go halves with me!”
interrupted Arthur, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed! and now he would fulfil that promise
by showing you what to buy, and then recommending
us to purchase from you; a very nice way
of doing business for him, doubtless—very nice
indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“I wish to God I had never gone into the Company
at all!” broke out the Squire, weakly and
passionately; “and I did it on the strength of your
name, and the names of men like you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was foolish,” said Mr. Stewart; “if you had
asked me for advice, I should decidedly have recommended
you to leave the Protector Flour and
Bread Company, Limited, alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you expect to make money out of it,” said
Arthur, obstinately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I am also prepared to lose money,”
was the reply; “which fact constitutes the difference
between us. If a man be, as I have always been, a
speculator, he takes the rough with the smooth, the
failure with the success. I lay out my plans as
well as I can, but I, at the same time, take my
chance. Moreover, Mr. Dudley, I can afford to
wait for success; you, perhaps, are not quite so
fortunately situated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you come here to insult me?” asked the
Squire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; on the contrary, I came here to help you,
if you will permit me to do so. We are not playing
quite a fair game,” added the director, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>sudden frankness. “You are showing me your
hand—I have scarcely given you a sight of mine.
Suppose, I say unreservedly, I also have embarked
more money in this venture than I should care to
lose, we should then stand on more equal terms.
You have advanced money to float the Company; I
am a shareholder—a <i><span lang="fr">bona-fide</span></i> shareholder, remember—to
a large amount; I do not want our ship to
go to the bottom, neither do you; Mr. Black, a
very worthy individual, no doubt, has a knack of
floating companies, and then sinking them. Now, it
is not your interest, any more than it is mine, that
this Company should fail; we want to see the shares
at a premium, and to secure regularly-paid and
satisfactory dividends. There is nothing to prevent
such a desirable consummation, if the affairs of the
Company be only properly managed. Now, if any
nominee of your friend, Mr. Black, be appointed
permanent secretary, there is no telling what the
end of the matter may prove. Therefore, I offer
you this secretaryship; say the word, and you
shall have it. We will rent the Lincoln’s Inn
premises from you; there is a good house there
in which you might reside, and you would then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>be on the spot to look after your own interests,
and those of your fellow-shareholders.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur wavered: the temptation was great, the
salary sounded large, but he did not feel inclined
so readily to turn his back on an old friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you had such an opinion of Mr. Black,” he
said, “why did you ever go into this Company with
him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for that,” answered Mr. Stewart, with a
smile, “there is scarcely an undertaking of the kind
which has not one black sheep at least in its
ranks. Now, I am quite aware of the nature of
Mr. Black’s weakness, and, you may recollect, it is
stated to be better to have to do with a devil you
know, than a devil you do not know. Further,
Mr. Black is undeniably clever, and he has, equally
undeniably, got hold of a good thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet you say, had I consulted you in the
first instance, you would have advised me to keep
clear of it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the terms—yes,” was Mr. Stewart’s reply.
“Had Mr. Black come to you and said, ‘Here are
a couple of hundred shares, paid up, which will
qualify you to act as a director, let me have your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>name on our board in exchange,’ I should have recommended
you to accept his offer, because, if the
Company succeeded, there were the shares; if it
failed, you had no liability; either way, you would
have been safe. But when it comes to advancing
money—even on the best security that Mr. Black
could offer—the case is materially altered. I should
not have counselled such a risk as that, Mr. Dudley,
depend upon it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think Mr. Black will not repay me,
then?” asked Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not think Mr. Black can repay you,”
amended Mr. Stewart; “with the best will in the
world, I am confident that he has not the means
of doing so at present. His other companies will
swallow up every available sixpence he can scrape
together for the next twelvemonth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I have my shares,” said the Squire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True; but paid-up shares are never of any
real marketable value, unless all the shares are
paid up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why?” was the next inquiry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because,” explained Mr. Stewart, “no man will
pay ten pounds for that which he can buy immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>for two: as, for instance, if you went on the
market to-morrow, you would not be so foolish as to
purchase a paid-up share, in any company, for
twenty pounds, if you could procure exactly the
same advantages for five. You could but pay your
calls, if they were demanded; you would not rush to
your bankers and write a cheque for the full sum at
once. In some prospectuses—in one of Mr. Black’s,
by-the-bye—there is a very delicious paragraph, to
the effect, that ‘although no further calls will be
made at shorter intervals than three months, and
then in amounts not exceeding one pound per share,
still the shareholders may, at any time after allotment,
pay up their shares in full, receiving interest
on such payments at the rate of six per cent. per
annum!’ I never met with a man desirous of paying
up his shares in full, however,” finished Mr. Stewart
with a quiet laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mean, then, to tell me that until all the
shares are paid up, those I have will remain valueless?”
demanded Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Comparatively so,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then what good—if I cannot sell my shares, nor
dispose of my property, and if there be no chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of Mr. Black dividing his profits with me—is this
Company likely to do to me or mine?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will have your dividends, if we are lucky
enough ever to get any,” answered Mr. Stewart;
“and, should you entertain my proposal, I promise
you the secretaryship also; that will yield you a
thousand a year. Perhaps you will consider the
matter, Mr. Dudley, and let me know your decision
before Saturday next. You have my address. I
shall be returning to town to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the great man rose to go, having, as he felt
confident, settled the business which had brought
him down into Hertfordshire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur accompanied him to the outer door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a lovely place you have!” said the director,
looking round, approvingly. “A spot I
should covet, if it were twenty miles nearer London.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very inaccessible,” Arthur agreed. This
light kind of conversation appeared to him very
much like the political small talk to which a surgeon
will sometimes treat a patient next day after
an operation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would not be exactly convenient for a man
who wished to be in town every day at eight o’clock,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>suggested Mr. Stewart; “but it is very charming,
nevertheless. Good-morning!” And this man, who
was between seventy and eighty years of age, started
off to walk back to Kemms Park, as briskly as
Arthur himself might have done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Old enough to have given up grubbing after
money,” muttered Arthur, criticizing his visitor’s
retreating figure; as though a man ever fancied
himself old enough to relinquish the occupation of
his life, so long as he could hold a pen or dictate a
letter, bring a bill into Parliament, or buy to advantage
on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old enough! Is it not only the young, now-a-days,
who feel old and cry aloud for rest; who grow
weary and tired of the heat and burden of the noontide?
When the back has become used to the
pack, and the world’s collar has ceased to gall, the
horse, let it be ever so old, will amble along the
familiar road, without whip or spur to urge him on.
It is the colts who turn aside, who long for the idle
days and the green pastures, for the meadows where
the holiday-folks are making merry, and the silvery
streams flowing through the midst.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='c009'>A FEW BILLS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Hitherto, Squire Dudley had, since his connection
with Mr. Black, experienced no shortness of
money. The man who spends two years’ income
in one, does not, as a rule, find the pecuniary shoe
begin to pinch until he enters on the second twelvemonth,
and realises to himself the truth that it is
impossible both to spend and to have.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a time of plenty during which the prodigal
wastes his substance and takes life easily, and
then after that comes the season of famine, when
he is fain to content himself with very roots and
husks—when, having once entertained like a prince,
he is compelled to expiate his folly in retirement,
and refresh his spirit with herbs of the field, and
water from the brook.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>In Joseph’s dream, the seven fat kine preceded
the seven lean; the same rule was observed also
in Squire Dudley’s less prudent experience, though
it produced by no means a like result. Never, for
many and many a long year, had Arthur been so
flush of cash, and so careless about expending it, as
in the days before Mr. Stewart’s friendly visit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lightly come, lightly gone, that was the way
with his money then! It is difficult for a man, such
as Arthur Dudley, exactly to realise the fact that
lending his name may eventually prove the hardest
day’s work he ever did in his life; in truth, it is a
fact difficult for any one unacquainted with business,
to understand theoretically. It is but a few strokes
of the pen, and the thing is done. Your obliging
friend, who has been kind enough to draw out the
document for you, and perhaps even buy the stamp,
gets the paper discounted. He takes out of it what
you promised to let him have, and duly hands over
the remainder.</p>

<p class='c011'>The money is then a certainty—the bill, an
illusion, is gone; your friend will meet it, never
fear. He tells you not to trouble your head about
the matter. Like Mr. Black, he will “take a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>memorandum of it,” and that memorandum seems
to you a perfect security for the genuineness of the
transaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Time, however, goes by; the money is spent, the
bill is coming due; then it is the first item which
appears the illusion; the latter, the certainty. Concerning
wasted sovereigns and mis-spent five-pound
notes, a useless jeremiade is sung.</p>

<p class='c011'>If you had but the past to live over again, you
think, how differently you would act; meantime,
however, you cannot live the past over again, and
the bill is coming due.</p>

<p class='c011'>When it does come due, there is only one thing of
which you may be morally certain, namely, that
you will have to take it up; that, spite of your
friend’s memorandum and assurances, he will be at
the last moment disappointed, and so disappoint
you.</p>

<p class='c011'>You have had your cake, or at least a portion of
that dainty; you have eaten and digested it; and
now comes the time for payment; now come the
anxious days and sleepless nights; now begins the
begging, borrowing, realising; you have within five
pounds of the amount required—you might as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>not have a penny; you must scrape those other
hundred shillings together before five o’clock on the
evening of the day of presentation, or else your
precious document falls into the notary’s hands.
In his hands there is still another short chance for
your credit; but fail to avail yourself of that, and
what ensues?</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Black was the man to have given every possible
information on this subject. I do not think
any other human being ever had so many bills returned
to him as he; it is doubtful if any one in
the length and breadth of London had devoted so
much time to raising the wind; whether there ever
existed any one who, so almost invariably, never took
up his bills at all, or drove up with what he called
the needful to the door of his bank, at the very
stroke almost of four, or rushed away to the other
bank where the bill was lying, or else to the notary’s
in Finch Lane.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a reality dishonoured bills may prove, Mr.
Peter Black had, many a time and oft, personally
tested, in the pleasant retirement of the Cripplegate
Hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the lofty public room of that desirable house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of public entertainment, he had frequently made
vows against paper, and mentally signed the pledge
of total abstinence against all accommodation bills,
but vows registered among a number of fellow-victims,
amid a Babel of strange tongues, or in the
shady courts and cool corridors that used to be so
much approved and patronized by former dwellers
in Whitecross Street; with visions of angry creditors,
and an unsympathetic commissioner in perspective,
are apt to be forgotten when the man is free again—free
to push his way forward—to trade, and
struggle, and strive, and get into trouble again, if
he list.</p>

<p class='c011'>A bill was nothing to Mr. Black. He had done
in bills all his life. Trading, as was his fashion,
always in advance of his fortune, it will readily be
believed that “paper” was to him the very soul of
business—that soul, in fact, which animated what
would otherwise have been a very dead, stupid,
helpless sort of body.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Black’s diary of bills to meet was a literary
curiosity well worth inspecting, if it were borne at
the same time in mind that the promoter had not
sixpenny-worth of real tangible property in the
world.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>But he had that which often stands a man in
much better stead than property: he had faith; and
it is not in religious matters only that faith is able
to remove mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>He believed utterly in himself and in his own
financial abilities; by means of this belief, he was
enabled not merely to remove mountains, but also
to create them out of molehills; wonderful companies—endless
Limited Liabilities—great works
were developed from the merest, paltriest, smallest
businesses that any one could mention.</p>

<p class='c011'>And because of his faith he was, conversationally,
rather a pleasant man with whom to be connected
in business. Let who else would, sing a poor song,
he “never said die;” let who might be cross and
changeable, faint-hearted and desponding, Mr. Black
was always the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>Always self-reliant, cheery, hopeful, certain of
success, that sort of man who never meets an acquaintance
with a long face; who is not affected by
the weather, who shakes hands just as heartily if
the rain be pouring down Heavens hard, as he would
if it were the finest day in summer; who considers
snow a joke, and frost an agreeable change; who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>never down on his luck; whose barometer, according
to his own showing, is always rising; with whom
it is, at least, fair weather from January till December;
who, if he do chance to get a heavy blow, is
only staggered by it for the moment; who is not
eternally complaining about his own health, or his
wife’s health, or the sickness of his ten children,
or the bad state of trade, or the difficulties of fighting
through, but who always says, with a cheery
nod—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite well, thank you. Business? oh, capital;
never had such a month—more work to do than I
can get through. Wish I could cut myself up to be
in a dozen places at once. All well with you?
that’s right; good-day, good-day!”</p>

<p class='c011'>To a man like this, it may readily be imagined,
Arthur Dudley proved a perfect mine of wealth—a
true God-send, as he reverently remarked to Mr.
Bailey Crossenham.</p>

<p class='c011'>When first he and Arthur started together in the
new Company, Mr. Black informed the Brothers
Crossenham that “he drew it mild with the Squire;”
but soon, finding that gentleman believed every
word he told him, the promoter grew less delicate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and would persuade his kinsman to accept three or
four bills for him in the course of a week.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was such a rare experience for Mr. Black to
hold thoroughly good paper—paper concerning
which no objection could be made, that he felt it
would be quite a slighting of Providence not to enjoy
that strange sensation thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c011'>To allow a name like Dudley’s to waste its sweetness
among the Hertfordshire fields, and never
figure on stamped slips of foolscap in banks and
discount offices, would have seemed to Mr. Black
the merest quixotism.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was what he had always sighed for—a good
name. Like the individual who would have given
ten thousand pounds for a good character, because,
on the strength of that character, he could have
trebled that sum immediately, Mr. Black conceived
that one good name must inevitably lead to more.
Should he suffer this gift to lie unused—should he
allow this talent to remain buried in a napkin?
Never; a thousand times, never. And, accordingly,
he employed Arthur’s name as freely as he
might his own, which is saying a good deal; and
Arthur rested satisfied.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Would not money turn in after Christmas. Were
he and Mr. Black not to go shares? Would those
thousands not be returning to him from the sale of
the Lincoln’s Inn property? Was the Company not
well thought of—well talked about? Had not
Walter Hope—spite of his aunt’s remonstrances—added
his name to the Direction, without a moment’s
hesitation? Had he not said to Mrs. Walter Hope,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the dividends shall be yours, my love?”
an arrangement which met with that lady’s entire
approval. Had Mr. Douglas Croft not remarked
that Black was “a sly fox, but a devilish clever
fellow—a fellow who could float anything, if he
only took it into his head to do so?” Had he not
tasted of the sweets of spending money freely—of
spending without pausing first to consider, “Can I
afford this expense?”</p>

<p class='c011'>His deeds now went in front, and his prudent
thoughts lagged slowly behind. After the long
Lent of fasting and humiliation—of poverty and
strict abstinence from all extravagance—from all
worldly pleasures—all social amusements—there
suddenly dawned an Easter morning on his life,
full of brightness and pleasure—a morning when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>old traditions were forgotten, and a new era was
begun.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Stewart’s visit was the first occurrence which
cast an actual shadow over all this radiancy. Previously,
light clouds might have swept across the
sky—a few misgivings through his heart—so far, he
had neither seen nor heard anything of the money,
some portion of which he knew, for certain, Mr.
Black must have received. Neither had letters
from that gentleman arrived with quite their accustomed
punctuality at Berrie Down. “Christmastime,”
the promoter stated, threw everything, for
a short period, out of gear, and then ensued
silence, until on the morning of Mr. Stewart’s
visit came a communication ending with these
ominous words,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am right for the bill due on Saturday, but
should like to see you about the others.”</p>

<p class='c011'>About the others! Good Heavens, what concern
were they of Squire Dudley’s? Mr. Black, or
the bank, or the Company, or somebody, was to take
them up; certainly not Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>The herds and flocks, the crops and Nellie, had
represented to Squire Dudley tangible property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>advanced into the “Protector Bread and Flour
Company, Limited,” but his name seemed the very
vaguest valuable possible, and he had stared at
first, when Mr. Black suggested using it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, however, the very vagueness of the
threatened peril filled his mind with alarm. What
could Mr. Black want with him? and what did he
mean by being “right for that on Saturday?”
Was he not right for all? and if he were not, how
did he expect the sight of Squire Dudley to put
him so?</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a terrible uncertainty about the matter
which seemed very frightful to Arthur; and then,
on the top of this letter—following it almost as
swiftly as the thunderclap does lightning—came
Mr. Stewart, and the interview already detailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Altogether, the second day in the new year was
not one marked with a white stone in Squire
Dudley’s memory, yet it brought, in due time, its
consolation, for pondering over the matter, Arthur
discovered two tangible pieces of comfort on which
to hang his hopes: one, the offer of the secretaryship;
the other, Mr. Stewart’s own evident belief in
the ultimate success of the Company.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“So I will run up to town to-morrow and see
Black,” decided Squire Dudley—who had vainly
striven to catch a glimpse of that gentleman on
Boxing Day, when he went to inform Mr. Ormson of
his daughter’s misdemeanor—“and I will tell him
frankly about the secretaryship, so that there may
be no underhand dealing in the matter, and I can
see how the place in Lincoln’s Inn would suit for a
residence, and then give Mr. Stewart a decided
answer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Already his opera-box and horses and carriages,
his grand town residence, his hunters, his hacks,
his fashionable friends, were dwindling down to
a thousand a year and a free house—to work which,
slight though it might be, was more than he had
ever thought of previously attempting. Already the
dream-castle was beginning to fade away, and the
sober stone-and-mortar building of reality taking
its place; but Arthur Dudley resolutely refused to
see the inevitable change which had commenced
being wrought.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bitten by the mania prevalent amongst those men
with whom he had latterly freely associated, the
Squire would not regard the secretaryship as anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>except a useful step onward—a mere trifle
which would keep him in funds till the Company
began to pay dividends, and shares rose to some
enormous premium.</p>

<p class='c011'>When a person is making an imaginative fortune,
there can be no possible reason why he should not
do the thing thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mentally, it is as easy to nett fifty thousand
pounds as one—to send shares up to fabulous
prices as to keep them at par; in fact, if a man
once lets his fancy get the reins, he may mount
to whatever height pleases him and his charioteer
best.</p>

<p class='c011'>The only drawback to which proceeding is, that
if he get a fall, he stands a chance of being badly
injured by it. Even Fancy seldom travels with a
free ticket—there are expenses incident on a too
great intimacy with that fair lady. She is apt to
lead people a good deal astray sometimes, with her
glancing smiles and her bright bewitching eyes—with
her sweet tones, which fall so pleasantly on the
ear—with her seductive words, which ring such
pleasant changes on the usually prosaic bells of
life.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>But Arthur Dudley was not a man to turn back
into the cold realms of reality when once he had
basked in the sunshine of prospective success. Children
think that they can keep back the rain-cloud
by turning their eyes away from that corner of the
heavens whence the wind is blowing; and, in like
manner, Squire Dudley persisted in looking at the
spot of blue which revealed itself in his sky, and
resolutely ignoring all the blackness which was
sweeping up behind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ‘Protector’ should pay”—even Mr. Stewart
had said something to that effect; and the very first
thing which met Arthur’s delighted gaze, as he
walked down Gray’s Inn Lane from the King’s
Cross Station, was a huge vehicle—apparently constructed
on the joint models of a police-van and a
cattle-truck, driven by a man in a quiet livery of
orange and green, and guarded by a hanging footman,
decked out in the like complimentary colours—which
vehicle bore on its sides this inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'><span lang="la">Vis Unita Fortior</span></span>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>the motto of the Company, its device being a bundle
of sticks firmly tied together.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Then followed—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>Protector</span>”</div>
    <div class='c003'>FLOUR AND BREAD COMPANY (LIMITED).</div>
    <div class='c003'>INCORPORATED UNDER ACT OF PARLIAMENT,</div>
    <div class='c003'>For the purpose of Supplying the Public with the Best Bread at the Lowest Possible Price.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c011'>If this did not look like business, Arthur wondered
what would. If all that varnish and gilding,
all that lettering and painting, did not indicate success,
he was very much out in his calculations. It
was only the third day for the vans to be out, and
they had not yet lost their pristine brilliancy. They
were clean and fresh, as though they had that moment
come out of the builder’s hands—the liveries
were free from spot or stain—the brass of the harness
was bright as lacquer—the horses were groomed to
perfection—the drivers and the men behind both
looked, in their fine conspicuous clothing, conscious
and conceited, and, perhaps, a little shamefaced
besides.</p>

<p class='c011'>The London boys cheered the splendid conveyance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and put, at the same time, various rude questions
to the individuals in charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The idle, dirty, half-starved looking women who
are always gathered round the entrance to those
wretched courts leading out of Gray’s Inn Lane,
stared after the vehicle, and made audible comments
upon it, which Arthur could hear as he passed by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very well-dressed people also took notice of the
van, and wondered what the meaning of the motto
might be. Ladies were especially interested in this
question; and Arthur longed to stop and tell a few
of the sweet creatures—not merely the English of
<i><span lang="la">Vis Unita Fortior</span></i>, but also that he was one of the
directors in the great Company.</p>

<p class='c011'>Walking down Gray’s Inn Lane, the Squire certainly
was a proof of the truth of his own quotation.
As a master baker, singly, he would have felt very
much ashamed of his trade, and vexed by any public
recognition of it. As a master baker, associated
with other gentlemen and noblemen also bakers,
Squire Dudley conceived himself a person of importance,
one of a body of philanthropists, who, “hearing
the cry of the people for bread, pure bread,
sweet, wholesome, nutritious bread, at a moderate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>price, had determined on forming themselves into a
Company which, under the name of the ‘Protector,’
should guard alike the rights of producer and consumer—supply
the public with the best bread at the
lowest remunerative prices—ensure to the shareholders
a fair and certain return for capital—do
away with unwholesome, ill-ventilated, badly-constructed,
insufficient and uncleanly bakehouses, and
render the trade wholesome and remunerative to the
employés connected with it, instead of permitting it
to remain, as hitherto, a blot on nineteenth century
civilization—one of the most enervating, pestiferous,
dangerous trades which could be conceived.”—<i><span lang="la">Vide</span></i>
Prospectus.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is one of the many beauties of a Limited
Liability Company: a man can have all the excitement,
profit, and pleasure of trade, without any of
its unpleasantness.</p>

<p class='c011'>If he be one of the directors on the board of,
say “The Private Dwelling Chimney-Sweeping
Association,” he still remains a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Bankruptcy Court, indeed, where some
singular anomalies are still permitted to exist, he
might be styled a dealer and chapman; but in West
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>End drawing-rooms his standing is above suspicion.
He is a wise individual who, despising trade, is still
not above making use of it; who, knowing nothing
of business, would nevertheless go and reap of the
corn which his hand neither planted nor watered;
he can do, as Squire Dudley wished to do, “gather
where he has not strawed,” and march in and out
of City offices as though the whole of the Lord
Mayor’s kingdom from Ludgate to the Tower, and
from Moorgate to London Bridge, belonged to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was with this feeling Arthur Dudley, spite of
his anxieties, entered the temporary offices in Dowgate
Hill, where he was greeted by Mr. Black with
an uproarious joviality.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, old fellow, and how are you? Bills
brought you up express, I see; thought nothing
short of them could get me a speedy sight of you.
I did not want you about them at all, you know,
really, for I could have sent you the renewals to sign by
post as easily as not. Yes, we must renew. I have
such a devil of a lot of things on hand at the present
time—good things, but still all crying out for money.
Well, and how are you? and your charming lady, and
my friend Lally, you know? Poor little cricket! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>was deucedly sorry to hear of her being so ill; and
oh! isn’t that a business about Ormson’s daughter!
By Jove! the old man is cut up, and no mistake.
Mrs. O. takes it better than he—comes the Roman
matron and that sort of thing; think I liked her
quite as well before I heard her declaiming against
the girl. Mrs. Black believes her sister forced
Bessie to accept Harcourt against her will, and led
her a nice life at home over it. I always considered
Mrs. O. a very superior sort of woman; but I
suppose God who made it is the only one who
rightly understands female nature. It is an enigma
to me. Who’s she off with, Squire? Come, it is
all in the family, and you need not keep the matter
dark here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not the remotest idea,” answered Arthur.
“No one seems able to give the slightest clue. She
must have been a sly, deep girl to make a flight
like that. She bribed one of the servants, went
down the back staircase, out across the farm-yard,
away along the field avenue, and so into Berrie
Down Lane, where her lover, it appears, was
waiting for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was a very pretty girl, Dudley,” said Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Black, meditatively, speaking of her beauty already
in the past tense.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never saw anything so particularly wonderful
about her,” answered Arthur, coolly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, she might not be your style, you know;
but still she was undeniably pretty. Talking about
style, by-the-bye, I saw your old flame, Mrs. Croft,
yesterday. I suppose you are not touchy about a
fellow speaking his mind concerning her? You had
a miss there—such as a man might have of losing
his life. I’d as lief be married to the devil. Croft
asked me up to dinner, and I don’t think that
madame liked it; at any rate, she made herself
so confoundedly disagreeable that Croft seemed
downright ashamed of her. And didn’t she nag
him! that is enough. He broke a vase on the
drawing-room chimney-piece after dinner, and I
never heard a poor beast so pitched into in all my
life. And before the servants, too! If she had
said the one-half to me she said to him, I should not
have minded doing six months for what I would have
given her. A man was telling me a good thing
about Croft the other day. It appears he had been
complaining to some of his wife’s male relations about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the way she goes on, and this fellow, some fool of a
swell, did not seem able to make out what exact
fault Croft laid to her charge. ‘Isn’t she pwoper?’
he drawled out. ‘Proper!’ says Croft, in that sharp
off-hand way of his, ‘damnably proper.’ Ah, we
may laugh at it,” went on Mr. Black, doubtless
speaking figuratively, for he was not laughing, and
not a ghost of a smile could have been detected on
Arthur’s face; “but it must be the very deuce to be
tied to a woman like that. While she was going on
at him, blowing him up sky-high, and sweeping about
in her grand dress, with a crinoline big enough to
have camped out under, I thought of your wife,
Squire, and I said to a man this very morning, not
half-an-hour ago,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Dudley must be a deuced lucky fellow—not
merely to have missed that woman, but to have
got the wife he has. There is no sham there—no
angel one day, and devil the next.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur cleared his throat. He felt as though he
were choking; he wanted to make some withering
speech in answer to this officious fool, but he was not
quick of wit nor ready with repartee.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, to lose a woman, to be jilted, to have an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>heiress slip out of his fingers, to be supplanted by a
wealthier suitor, to be flung back from the height of
prospective affluence to the dead level of certain
poverty, and then to be congratulated on the subject,
and called a lucky fellow! To hear another
man who had gained the prize pitied for his, success,
and he, Arthur, felicitated on having chosen a wife
who did not suit him in the least. Arthur knew
Heather did not suit him—that she was not the woman
he ought to have married. At that moment he felt
very ungrateful both towards Heaven and the helpmeet
Heaven had sent him, and he felt further that
he hated Mr. Black with a perfect hatred, for which
reason, as he could not think of any specially clever
or cutting remark that might advantageously be
uttered, he turned the conversation into a channel
which he thought must prove disagreeable to Mr.
Black, and said,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speaking of Croft, Stewart called on me
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, yes,” answered the promoter, briskly;
“been down staying with his cousin, the Honourable
Augusta, I hear. That would be a nice suitable
match, now; thought it likely he might call. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>told you he meant to oppose the purchase of your
Lincoln’s Inn speculation, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your Lincoln’s Inn speculation, rather,” retorted
Arthur, a little indignantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Our</em> Lincoln’s Inn speculation, then, to meet the
views of both parties,” proposed Mr. Black. “So
he called to tell you about that, did he? People’s
ideas of civility differ. I would just as soon call
on a man to pick his pocket as to inform him I
meant to overthrow his plans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was not Mr. Stewart’s sole object in
calling,” remarked Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! indeed; and what might his object be, if
I am not too inquisitive?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all; I came up partly on purpose to tell
you. Guess the nature of the proposal he made.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That you should wind up the Company, or try
to do so; that he and you and Mr. Raidsford and
Lord Kemms should start an opposition bakery of
your own; that you should purchase Mr. Scrotter’s
flour-mill, and sell it to the Company; that you and
Mr. Stewart should agree to support each other
through everything. There, I have guessed often
enough. What is this wonderful proposal which he
made to you yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“Guess again. I would rather that you jumped
at it yourself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang it! I can’t guess what the old humbug
wanted with you. Did he propose marrying one of
your sisters?—or——I have it!” exclaimed Mr.
Black; “he offered you the secretaryship?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you accepted it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I did not: I felt a delicacy——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Felt nonsense!” interrupted Mr. Black; “how
could you be such a simpleton? You must be rich to
throw away a thousand a year for delicacy! Deuce
a thing to do except sit before the fire for a certain
number of hours reading the <cite>Times</cite>—have clerks
under you to do everything—read the <cite>Times</cite> for
you, if you like! And a secretaryship to which you
are appointed through the interest of Allan Stewart!
By Jove! it is as good as an annuity. You felt a
delicacy about interfering with Mr. Crossenham—that’s
the hitch, is it? Very nice, and proper, and
gentlemanly indeed—very; but Crossenham, you
see, is not going to retain the secretaryship—no,
not if we went down on our knees and prayed him
to keep it, which I, for one, have no intention of
doing.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“Why will he not keep it?” asked Arthur, in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because it don’t suit him,” was the reply. “He
has always been used to work, and he don’t like
idling. He says he has no fancy for loafing about,
with his hands in his pockets, drawing only a poor
two hundred and fifty a quarter, when there are
thousands of pounds to be picked up by any one
willing to look out for chances. Of course, he is
quite another style of fellow from what you are,
Dudley. He has been in business all his life; and
what really is a very good appointment for you,
seems almost like shelving him. I thought, as his
health was not very good, he might be glad of such
a berth. But no; he is hungering and thirsting
after work—work, and no gammon—that is what he
calls it. Besides, he hates talking to those swells
who are quite in your way, you know. If Crossenham
be your only objection, here is pen, ink, and paper—write
at once to Mr. Stewart, and say you accept his
offer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if I do that, I bind myself not to ask the
Company to purchase my Lincoln’s Inn property.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And much good it would do if you did ask the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Company to purchase it, with Allan Stewart against
you! Look here, Dudley. Stewart is going to be
the god of our board; so your best plan, if you
want things to go pretty square, is, thankfully to
receive all he likes to offer you. My power is gone,
you know. Whenever he came crowing it over me,
with his shares, and his influence, and his wealth,
and his connection, I gave in at once; so take a
friend’s advice, and accept. Did he promise to rent
the house from you? That is right. He proposed
you should live there! The very best thing possible.
Good airy rooms, central situation, near the
theatres, accessible to everywhere!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And about those bills, Mr. Black?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, about those bills! We must renew for a
few months, till my ventures begin to make me some
return. A mere matter of form! I will pay the
interest, of course, and you shall have back the old
bills. Here, Collins,” cried Mr. Black, opening the
door between the two offices, “run over the way
and get me a pound’s worth of bill-stamps. Three
shilling and two shilling—four of each. Look
sharp now, and don’t be the whole day about it.
While we are ‘melting,’ you might as well have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>a few hundreds, might you not, Dudley? You will
want some money to carry you over till quarter-day,
and there will be the expenses connected with moving,
and so forth. How much?—say three! You know
we can always get more, if you run short.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But supposing that you are unable to meet those
bills?” ventured Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, then, we must renew again,” answered
Mr. Black, cheerily, “and renew, and renew, and
renew till one or other of us comes into his fortune.
We cannot be kept out of it for ever,” added Mr.
Black, jocularly. There was no having this man;
once afloat with him, no one need ever after expect
to touch solid land—once launched in the same
boat, and you had to obey Captain Black, who
would have laughed while sending one of the crew
to his death, and kept “up the steam” had his
nearest friend been dying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spite of his good spirits, however, Arthur ventured
to interrogate him concerning the marketable value
of paid-up shares, as to which the promoter’s opinion
was almost identical with that of Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But they are available as security,” proceeded
Mr. Black. “For instance, if you were pushed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>money, you could get an advance upon them. They
are much the same as Berrie Down, you understand,
tangible property—something to show, if a creditor
turns crusty, or discount rises too high. We shall,
all of us, do very well yet; and I am glad you are
coming to town. You will never care to go back to
Hertfordshire afterwards, even when you are worth
ten thousand a year. Here are the stamps; that is
right. Now, Dudley, I must trouble you for a
moment. Let us first see the amounts, however, of
those we must renew;” and Mr. Black, pulling out
his pocket-book, consulted various memoranda which
it contained, all having reference to certain of the
bills coming due as fast as the autumn peaches
ripen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I may as well give you a cheque for three
hundred,” said Mr. Black; “no need to be sending
it down after you;” and Peter Black forthwith drew
a cheque for three hundred pounds in favour of
Arthur Dudley, Esquire, on order, which document
he crossed, “Hertford and South Kemms’ Banking
Company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Stewart would have known that he did this in
order to give himself time to get some of Arthur’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>acceptances discounted before the cheque came back
to his bankers; but Squire Dudley, being less acquainted
with business manœuvres than the great
director, thought it was all in the ordinary course
of affairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not occur to him either as singular that
many of the bills he accepted should bear no
drawer’s signature attached—an omission Mr. Stewart
would at once have detected and challenged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Truth was, Mr. Black and the two Crossenhams
played into each other’s hands, thus: the Crossenhams
would get a bill discounted at their bankers, the
produce of which Black would then pay into his
own bank. Then he would get a bill discounted,
with Crossenhams’ name to it as drawer, and hand
that amount over to Crossenhams. Thus, the bills
went dancing about like shuttlecocks—they were paid
away, they were discounted, they were given as
security, and nobody but Mr. Black knew for what
exact sum Arthur had made himself liable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Enough to puzzle Berrie Down,” said Mr. Black
to himself, thoughtfully, as, after Arthur’s departure,
he totted up the amounts attached to the memoranda
of which mention has previously been made; “enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to puzzle Berrie Down, if the ‘Protector’ come to
grief; but it shall not do that, not, at any rate,
until I have had my penn’orths out of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having arrived at which prudent and honest conclusion,
Mr. Black closed his pocket-book, circling it
for extra security with an india-rubber band. That
pocket-book, which never left Mr. Black’s person except
when he was asleep (and then he locked it up in
a small safe in his dressing-room), contained all the
present secrets of the promoter’s life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had Mr. Stewart only obtained a sight of the
pages that band kept so tightly together, he might
reasonably have considered the ultimate success of
the “Protector Bread and Flour Company, Limited,”
problematical.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c009'>HOW HEATHER TOOK IT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The secretaryship was duly accepted, although not
by letter; Arthur Dudley thought it best to call
upon Mr. Stewart, and express in person his willingness
to fill up the post offered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Probably a secret pride influenced this determination.
After a fashion, he was going to be the
man’s servant; but that was no reason why he
should not return Mr. Stewart’s call, and place
himself on a footing of social equality with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>For this reason, also, he did not walk from Dowgate
Hill to King’s Arm Yard, and take his chance
of seeing Mr. Stewart at his office, as anybody else,
standing less upon his dignity, might have done;
but, at considerable inconvenience, repaired next
afternoon to the great director’s house, where, of
course, he did not find him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>This, however, was a matter of secondary importance.
The Squire had done the proper thing in
the proper manner, and, having left his card, went
back to Mr. Black’s abode satisfied.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same evening a messenger arrived in Stanley
Crescent with a note from Mr. Stewart, expressive of
regret at having missed seeing Mr. Dudley, and begging
him to breakfast with the writer the following
morning at ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A business fellow,” observed Mr. Black, approvingly,
“and worth such a lot of money; I
wonder who will have it when he dies. Croft,
likely as not. Is there not some scripture about
people who have much, getting more?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very heartily Arthur Dudley secretly anathematised
this Croft, who seemed to be now, as he
thought, for ever under his nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already he was beginning to have personal
experience of the truth Mr. Raidsford had mentioned
to Lord Kemms—namely, that people always
meet again; that, let the circle in which they revolve
be large or small, still they ultimately come back to
the point whence they started, and are brought once
more into contact with the men and the women they
knew at that period in their career.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>If he please, a man may, like Arthur Dudley,
curse the old ties, and strive to break away from
them; but, like Arthur Dudley also, he will find
after the years that there is no severance possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Friends and acquaintances; those whom we once
knew well; those whom we have merely met, crop
up continually in our path. We come across them
in unlikely places; we encounter them in strange
houses; we are thrown against them under the most
singular circumstances. We leave them, as we
think, behind, and behold, we discover, when the
years roll by, that they have been travelling also;
that, during all the time which seemed to be increasing
the distance between us, we have really
been traversing gradually converging lines, which
bring us, after the springs, and the summers,
and the autumns, and the winters, face to face at
last.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, after years, for instance, was Squire Dudley
brought into contact once again with the people he
had known and dwelt among in his earlier manhood;
here, also, he was going to breakfast with the
bachelor of Scotch proclivities, who had so long ago
influenced the name bestowed upon Heather at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>baptism. Once more there was a likelihood of Mrs.
Dudley reviving the associations of her childhood,
and meeting with some of the members of her own
kith and kin.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Bells of Layford—amongst whom figured
prominently a Sir Wingrave Bell—had long been
friends of Mr. Allan Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scottish people all, come southward, they hung
together after the goodly manner of their country;
and, very probably, had it not been for the unhappy
quarrel which ended in utter alienation between the
Rector of Layford, and his cousin and patron’s eldest
friend and ally, Mr. Stewart would have done well
for his god-child when she was left an orphan, and
not relinquished her without a struggle into the
hands of Mrs. Travers, who had proved herself,
perhaps, a little unduly anxious to be rid of such
a trust.</p>

<p class='c011'>As it was, when Mr. Bell died, Mr. Stewart
chanced to be abroad. On his return he casually
inquired what had become of the daughter, and
being informed that her aunt had taken the orphan
to her own home, let the matter drop out of his
recollection. Of Heather’s connection with Arthur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Dudley he was completely ignorant, and Arthur
was not the man to acquaint him with it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But yet, while the Squire sat opposite to his host
at breakfast, he was wondering whether in due
course of time, if the fact did by any chance come
to Mr. Stewart’s knowledge, it might not prove
beneficial to himself; induce the director to withdraw
his opposition concerning the purchase of that
“desirable house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, with yard
at the back, over which a large room could be built
(see advertisement), and the right of walking in the
gardens of the Square.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Why this last clause always presented itself to
Arthur Dudley’s mind, it would be somewhat difficult
to say, since a board of directors is not usually alive
to the advantages of a “key to the Square;” but
still, that it did present itself is unquestionable, and
he thought about it while Mr. Stewart said he was
glad to hear his visitor had decided not to press the
matter on the Company, but to accept the secretaryship,
and take up his residence in Lincoln’s Inn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very good situation for a dwelling,” finished
Mr. Stewart, who would as soon have thought of
living in Lincoln’s Inn as he would have thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>of flying; “and a good house too. You are married,
I presume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur admitted the correctness of Mr. Stewart’s
supposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is right; every man ought to marry,” said
the bachelor. “Have you any children?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two—a boy and girl,” said the Squire; “one
of them is in very bad health. I do not know what
her mother will think about bringing her to town.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have not mentioned your intentions, then,
to Mrs. Dudley?” said Mr. Stewart, apparently
surprised.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought it would be time enough to tell her
when the matter was settled,” answered Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Evidently, then, you will not consider it necessary
to take your wife into your confidence concerning
all the affairs of our Company?” suggested the
director.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not think women ever understand anything
of business matters,” Arthur replied; then, noticing
Mr. Stewart smile, he added, “and I am positive
my wife would not wish me to tell her any of the
affairs of my principals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard of Mrs. Dudley as a lady of an
excellent discretion,” said Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“You do not expect me to praise my own wife,”
answered Arthur, deprecating this praise; and the
evasion was really rather a clever one for him. If
he had praised her at all, however, it would simply
have been as his wife, and because she belonged to
him, not in her mere capacity as a woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Stewart felt curious about this Mrs. Dudley,
whose husband so decidedly refused to speak of her.
Miss Baldwin had been by no means so reticent.
She had described Heather to her cousin, and told
him all about the brothers and sisters who used to
run wild before the young wife’s arrival at Berrie
Down. Lally also was not left out of the narrative.
“The sweetest little creature in the world,”
the Honourable Augusta declared; “just the child
you would love, Mr. Stewart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never saw the child I loved yet,” said the old
bachelor, somewhat incredulously, “and I do not
think I ever shall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding this speech, however, Mr. Stewart
had been secretly touched by Miss Baldwin’s description
of mother and child, which description
caused him to form a mental picture of Mrs. Dudley
that did not exactly frame in the setting Arthur
now provided for her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“Is this fellow such a weak fool as to be envious
of his wife,” thought the director; “or is there
really some flaw in his pearl of which the little
world of South Kemms is not cognisant?” Mr. Stewart
could not understand his companion’s domestic relations,
so he thought he would try him on another
tack—his children.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard something, when I was at Kemms Park,
about your little girl having met with an accident,”
he began.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she fell into that mill-pond at the bottom
of my farm, and was nearly drowned,” Arthur
replied, shortly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has been very ill since that, though, has
she not?” asked Mr. Stewart, who was beginning to
think his visitor carried his ideas of politeness a little
too far.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very ill; but she is now out of danger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think of bringing her up to town?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will be a question for her mother to
decide.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was there ever such a prig before!” thought
the director; but he said out loud, “Then you take
nothing to do with such minor matters?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“Nothing,” answered Arthur, decidedly; “my
wife has had a vast amount of anxiety concerning
the child, and I should not like to interfere; though,
I should think,” added the Squire, “that if once we
could get her up to London and under better medical
treatment, she would soon be well again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you not take a doctor down to see
her?” asked Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The expense,” murmured his guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True, I had forgotten,” said the director apologetically;
but while he meditatively finished his tea,
he remembered the money Arthur had advanced to
Mr. Black, and spent uselessly on the purchase of
the house he now proposed occupying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I presume that, whether or not Mrs. Dudley
come to town at once, you can enter on the duties
of your new post immediately?” Mr. Stewart said, at
length.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly; if my wife be afraid of leaving home,
one of my sisters must come up and keep house for
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have sisters, then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was enough; that question speedily loosened
Arthur’s tongue; on that portion of his family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>history he was never—the chance of speaking being
given to him—dumb.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he had sisters, but they were not his own,
they were sisters by a second marriage. His father
had made a most imprudent choice of a wife without
money or connection, who brought five children into
the world that I,” said Arthur, “have had to clothe,
educate, and support. That is what has kept me a
poor man. For thirteen years I have had that
burden to carry. You cannot wonder at my being
as I am. One of the boys has now got a situation,
but he is only earning thirty pounds a year, and that
will not do much towards keeping him. You perceive
how necessary it is for me to add to my
income. With my own children growing up, it is
impossible for me to avoid feeling uneasy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your sisters will marry?” suggested Mr.
Stewart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know who is to marry them,” said
Arthur, ruefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“People do not know generally, until the right
man comes,” said the bachelor, laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur struck him as being eminently absurd. It
was long since he had come in contact with a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>he more thoroughly despised; but, all unconscious of
the impression he was producing, Arthur went on
talking of his grievances, of how badly fortune had
treated him, and Mr. Stewart encouraged such talk.
He wanted to know of what stuff his companion was
made; and so Arthur proceeded, without the faintest
idea crossing his mind that he was revealing himself
all the while in a most unfavourable light; that there
was not a speck, or flaw, or weak point, in his most
weak character, which his host was not examining
critically and cynically.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away from Heather, away from that most beautifying
influence, which made even his faults seem
errors, to be lightly viewed and tenderly treated for
the sake of the love she bore him; away from the
wife, who was unto him as a crown giving some faint
semblance of man’s royalty to that poor weak brow,
Arthur stood confessed for what he was—a feeble, impulsive,
wearisome, selfish egotist, who had a quarrel
with the world, because, while it contained rich
and poor, and he did not stand amongst the former;
who laid the burden of his ill-success on every back
save his own; who would not look on the bright
side of his actual existence, but had suffered himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>to be led away after a will-o’-the-wisp by Mr.
Black, and who lacked, as Mr. Stewart delicately
implied to him, sense and energy sufficient to make
a good thing of his life, and a good income out of
Berrie Down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have no rent to pay,” said the director;
“it seems to me you might have got a fortune out
of that lovely place of yours, had you only gone to
work thoroughly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?” asked Arthur, helplessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How? why, how do other people make money
out of land—make money and pay heavy rents into
the bargain? Do not think me impertinent, if I say
I would rather have trusted to the sense and gratitude
of Berrie Down Hollow than of Mr. Black.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur could not help thinking Mr. Stewart not
merely impertinent but foolish, although he replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not think there is much money to be made
by farming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you!” said Mr. Stewart. “I fancy I
have made more money by farming than by anything
else; but, however, no doubt you know your
own business best—every man does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur imagined he did, at any rate; nevertheless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>he left Mr. Stewart with a certain depression of
spirit, which was, however, in due time chased away
by Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come up again!” said that gentleman. “No,
you need not; deuce a bit of necessity for anything
of the kind. Leave all to me. I’ll see the
house is ready for you; Mrs. Black will send in a
charwoman, and all that sort of thing. I shouldn’t
move even a table from Berrie Down; nothing
but plate and linen. No use breaking up a
home. You’ll want to run down there occasionally
from Saturday till Monday. We’ll all
run down. Should not go to the expense; you will
furnish as cheaply as you could move your sticks.
Leave all to me. I’ll not put you to unnecessary
expense; but you know you must have decent
furniture about you. Servants! Oh, better let Mrs.
Dudley see to them—whatever messenger we have
can be made useful as footman also, remember. You’ll
charge him to the Company, as well as coals, gas,
taxes, and so forth. By Jove! Dudley, it will be a
first-rate thing for you. Living free, as one may
say, and drawing a thousand a year. I’ll get the
painters and paper-hangers in at once, and report
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>progress. The place shall be ready for you in a
fortnight. There, there, no thanks; tut, tut, man,
don’t make a fuss over such a trifle. Good-bye!
Remember me to Mrs. Dudley. Good-bye!” and,
amid much waving of hands and excited adieux, the
train steamed out of the station, and Arthur was off
for Palinsbridge, while Mr. Black returned to the
City.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the way down Arthur thought how he should
best break the news to Heather. It seemed to him
now, that if he had only made a confidante of her
all along, his way would have proved easier. He
should now have to tell her the whole from the
beginning, or at least as much of the whole as he
ever meant to tell her. How he had listened to the
voice of the charmer; how the charmer had given
him shares in the Protector Bread Company,
Limited; how he had been offered the secretaryship
of that thriving company; how he thought a
thousand a year much too good a chance to be refused;
how he had promised Mr. Stewart to enter
on his duties at once; how there was a house in
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, rented by the Company, which
they were to inhabit.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>He would have to tell her all this, but he need
tell her no more; he need not add how foolish and
trustful he had been; he need make no mention of
bills or money; there was no necessity for him to
say anything about the house in Lincoln’s Inn,
which he had purchased.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Berrie Down, to which some one must see,
could not Mrs. Piggott take charge of it? Mrs.
Piggott and Ned. Suppose Ned and Mrs. Piggott
made a match of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Piggott had, indeed, if all accounts were to
be believed, led her deceased husband such a “devil
of a life,” that he was glad, after three years’ patient
endurance of her temper, to skulk under ground to
get rid of it; but then those days lay very far back
in the woman’s life; she had been forced to struggle
with the world; she had buried two children; she
had “supped sorrow with the spoon of grief,” and
there are some natures to whom sorrow taken in any
form proves a very wholesome medicine.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had done so in Mrs. Piggott’s case; the years
had softened her, tamed her spirit, subdued her
temper. She would have made a very good wife to
any one wanting an elderly managing woman to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>cook his dinner and keep his house tidy; a very
good wife indeed for Ned, who had worshipped his
lost and lamented Polly—a “fine woman,” large,
well-developed, and handsome, whose only fault was
mildly represented by Ned to have been, that her
delicate health obliged her to take more gin than
was always good for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like Mr. Piggott, Polly had long been slumbering
where gin is not procurable; and thus Squire
Dudley’s idea concerning a match being got up
between the pair was perfectly feasible, and likely,
so he thought, to meet the views of all parties
interested in the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Piggott was faithful and trustworthy. So
also was Mr. Edward Byrne, a gentleman of Irish
extraction on his father’s side—a soft, willing, hardworking
fellow, full of odd sayings, and possessed of
unfailing spirits, which kept him continually at high
pressure, and ready at all times for anything, “from
pitch-and-toss to manslaughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Byrne could saddle a horse, and ride it afterwards;
harness one or a pair, and drive it or them likewise;
he could churn and he would pump; he
darned his own stockings, and he cobbled his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>shoes. He was always up betimes in the morning,
and could be depended on to see to the feeding of
the sheep and the foddering of the cattle. To Ned
was intrusted the key of the oat-bin, and he always
presided over the brewing of the ale. It was he
who had the mowers at work by four o’clock in the
summer’s mornings, whilst the grass was still wet
and heavy with dew; he who stacked the oats and
went to market for Squire Dudley. And yet, Ned
was not proud. Mrs. Piggott objected to young
men and boys about the house, so he did not disdain
cleaning the knives and polishing the boots, singing
to himself all the while like a perfect nightingale,
or else talking to Mrs. Piggott or the servants, and
recounting to them tales of a far remote period in
his life when he was “devil” in a printing-office,
and had to “cut about” with proof.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, Ned had acquired literary tastes and a
knowledge of minstrelsy, which made him a perfect
treasure at harvest-homes, sheep-shearings, and
such-like. Amongst his class he was considered an
orator, and it is greatly to be questioned whether
Mario was ever more warmly applauded than Mr.
Byrne, when at the festive board he “favoured the
company” with “Auld Lang Syne.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>A true diplomatist, he always selected songs
which would bear a chorus, well knowing that the
true secret of personal popularity is to induce every
one to believe that some portion of that popularity
is reflected on him or her.</p>

<p class='c011'>A man is, as a rule, much more heartily clapped
when the audience feel they are clapping themselves
at the same time—clapping their own talents, sentiments,
virtues; and Ned’s admirers accordingly
stamped their feet, and hammered on the table with
their spoons and knives in precise proportion as the
chorus to Mr. Byrne’s melody had been long, loud,
and discordant.</p>

<p class='c011'>After leaving the printing-office, which he quitted,
because, as he stated, the hours kept by authors
were bad for his constitution, he obtained a situation
with a lawyer residing in the Temple, whose
hours proved to be still worse than those affected
by the authors with whom Ned had previously
associated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You might get some sleep in the one case, drop
off in the hall, or have forty winks sitting on the
stairs, but with Mr. Froom there was rest neither
day nor night,” he said; so, finding that town habits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>were not to his mind, that he had to work harder in
London than “anybody ever was asked to work in the
country,” Ned, then a stunted, pale-faced, sickly lad,
resolved to cut the undesirable acquaintance of members
both of the literary and legal professions, and
return home to those peaceful shades where, in
former days, he had digested fat bacon, cheese in
quantity, and—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Home-made bread</div>
      <div class='line'>As heavy as lead;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>to say nothing of various other delicacies: such as
batter and Yorkshire puddings, treacle roll-up,
bubble-and-squeak, toad-in-the-hole, harslet-pie, and
liver-and-crow—fearful combinations, which are all
as appetising to the agricultural classes as the
daintiest dishes of a French <i><span lang="fr">chef</span></i> to the upper ten
thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon this fare, Ned, in the pure country air,
throve and grew apace, and when, in due time, he
took service with Major Dudley, of Berrie Down, he
was a fine, strapping fellow, willing and able to do
almost anything in the way of farm labour, and not
above putting his hand to whatever his hand found
to do. He had been “odd and useful man” at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Berrie Down so long back as the memory of Arthur
Dudley extended. His hair had grown grey from
the passage of years spent at the Hollow, and not,
as he facetiously informed young women, from its
having stayed out too long in the wet one night and
got mouldy.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was faithful and unambitious; but, nevertheless,
he had money to the good in South Kemms
Bank,—a fact which it is fortunate Mr. Black never
suspected, or he might, in the course of his wanderings
over the farm, and long discourses with
Ned, have induced him to go in for shares, and
inoculated man as well as master with a mania for
speculation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Piggott, likewise, had saved money. Why
should the pair not marry, and unite their common
earnings against the day when more work for either
would be impossible? Ned would make a good
husband to any woman; Mrs. Piggott would see to
his meals and his comforts, and, perhaps, not be too
hard upon him if he did take a pint too much ale
at any of the rustic gatherings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why should they not marry? why, at all events,
should they not be put in charge? That is, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Heather objected, as Arthur feared she would, to
leaving the girls and Cuthbert at the Hollow; while
he, and she, and Lally, and Leonard, went up to
town.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fact is,” was the solemn truth with which
Squire Dudley came home after his mental excursion,
“I never ought to have married. See how it
ties a man at the most important crisis of his life!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having arrived at which pleasant conclusion,
Arthur reached Palinsbridge, where Ned and a
horse awaited him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he rode homeward he pondered over and over
how he should best “break the news” to Heather.
Any one following his train of reflection might have
thought Mrs. Dudley was a perfect virago, so much
did her husband dread her reception of the intelligence
that he had accepted the secretaryship, and
meant, for the future, to reside in London.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost he wished he had asked Mr. Black to
come down and make the communication for him.
He knew Heather would not scold, or nag, or
strive to render him miserable about the matter, but
he knew also she would feel hurt at his reserve, his
secrecy, his want of trustfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Long ago she had asked him not to let them
drift away one from the other—what had she meant
by that? Was it possible Heather should ever
become reserved towards him? that her love should
ever grow less? her devotion ever dwindle and die
away altogether? Was what his aunt had told him
at Copt Hall true?—“You will not be able to retain
Heather’s affection for ever, Arthur, if you give
her none in return. You have got a wife such as
no man ever found before; take care lest you sustain
a loss such as no man ever can repair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What did it mean? Arthur Dudley pulled up
his horse to a walk, and asked himself this question
as he entered Berrie Down Lane.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had heard men say they never valued a
mother’s love till it could be given to them never more.
Was this what Miss Hope desired to imply? Did
she think Heather delicate? Did she imagine
there was any fear of her fading away and leaving
him? What would his life be without Heather?
Who would ever again bear with him, think for him,
love him, like the woman whom he now feared to
face,—whom he now rode slowly on to meet, slowly
though he knew she was waiting and watching for
his arrival?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>What a game of cross-purposes love is altogether!
What a stake some people throw down on the board,
what despairing losers many walk forth again into
the world!</p>

<p class='c011'>Make your game, gentlemen, make your game,
it is all a matter of business! The world must not
stand still, even though hearts be broken.</p>

<p class='c011'>Make your game! The game is made, and here
is the result: a great intellect mated to a fool, a
fond woman mismatched with a weak, or brutal, or
unloving husband!</p>

<p class='c011'>What, complaining? You played for happiness
and you have lost. There are other gamblers
coming forward—pray stand aside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Or it is a lottery, and the people come up to
draw. Only a doll, only an idiot, a shrew, a
tyrant, a faithless husband, a coquettish wife, a
plausible pretender: a woman all paint and padding,
all affectation and extravagance,—a man
polished enough in his manners, yet coarse and
repulsive in the ordinary course of every-day domestic
life!</p>

<p class='c011'>And you grumble? Pray, Sir, and Madam, did
you not pay your money and take your chance?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Have you not drawn <em>something</em> out of the matrimonial
lottery? It does not suit you? Oh! we
can have no exchanges here! there are your goods,
take them. “Here’s a lottery in which no man
draws a blank!” and so forth till the end of time;
so forth, while the men and the women go home
with their purchases, and shrine them or curse them,
according as the goods suit or their tempers incline.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a game of cross-purposes! what a lottery
of incongruous chances! What a singular thing
that Arthur and Heather should ever have married!
What a still more marvellous affair, that only after
the years, the possibility should occur to him of
her affection weakening, of her love decaying!</p>

<p class='c011'>What an awful mistake it is men and women
alike make, when they imagine that because love
has been, love will be, always!</p>

<p class='c011'>As though there were any human attachment
which constant dropping could not wear away; as
though the devotion existed which neglect and distrust,
unkindness and coldness, would not ultimately
alienate!</p>

<p class='c011'>Can the tendrils go on for ever feeling after a
support which is removed from them? Will there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>not come a day when they will either wither away,
or otherwise turn elsewhere for something around
which to twine? Was that what Miss Hope
meant? or did she only intend to imply that one
day, when he wanted the love, and the help, and the
companionship he now spurned, he should stretch
forth his hands in vain to meet only vacancy?</p>

<p class='c011'>Strange things often ride beside a man, keep his
company in the night watches, walk with him along
the familiar paths; strange things the ghosts of
“what has been,” the shadows of “what is to be;”
and it was most probably a mixture of both these
phantoms that caused Squire Dudley to spur his
horse, shying in the moonlight—on—and to push
forward more rapidly under the elms and the
beeches, beside the hedgerows, bare of flower and
leaf, across the gleaming brook—home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where Heather was waiting for him with the old
glad look of welcome in her face, with the soft
pleading tone in her voice, with the half timid
touch laid on his shoulder, “so pleased to see
him home again,” she said; “so thankful to be
able to tell him Lally was better—much better, and
she herself quite rested. Had he been well, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>had he settled his business satisfactorily?” He was
seated before the fire by this time with his top-coat
off, and his feet stretched out towards the warmth.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was at home, and the little bustle of arrival
over. The inevitable moment had come at last—the
moment when, if he ever were to tell his wife of
the impending change, the communication must be
made.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet, looking round, it did seem hard to break
up that pleasant home, to leave the familiar places,
and strive to set up the household gods of Berrie
Down on a strange shrine—in strange niches.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shadows which had pursued him up the Lane
must have entered at the open door and sat down
beside the Squire, for there was something, not
merely of dread, but also of regret, in his heart,
when turning, he said to Heather,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have news for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good news,” she said; “anything about Bessie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, nothing to do with any one but ourselves.
As for whether my news be good or bad, I cannot
tell, for that will depend somewhat on how you take
it. What should you say if I told you I had added
a thousand a year to our income?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“I should say it was almost too good to be true,”
she answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is true,” he said, “only there is one drawback—we
must leave Berrie Down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave Berrie Down!” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not mean leave it entirely,” he explained;
“but still, for a considerable part of each year, it
will be necessary for us to reside in town. We
shall have a large house there, rent free, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me what it all means, Arthur,” she said,
interrupting his confused sentence. “Begin at the
beginning, and explain it to me. Where is this
thousand a year coming from? Why is it necessary
we should live in town?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She knelt down beside him as she spoke: knelt
down, and leaning her elbows on the arm of the
chair he occupied, looked up in his face, with those
lovely, pleading, sad eyes, that had still the brooding
sorrow in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the first time, that expression struck Arthur
painfully; that expression of all not being happy in
her life, which it is so bitter a thing to behold in
the face of any one near and dear to us; that expression
of terrible though almost unconscious loneliness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>which is so pitiful, so pathetic, we can scarcely look
upon it without tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more let me paint her for you as she kneels
there in the fire-light,—let me paint her in the very
prime of her womanhood, with the rich warm tints
of her hair contrasting against her clear white skin,
with her small ears peeping out from below the
heavy braids which were wreathed round and round
her head, with her face uplifted towards Arthur, her
lips parted, her hands clasped, and that pleading
look in her eyes—that look which had in it something
of a dumb appeal—of an entreaty, which,
although the heart could conceive, the tongue
refused to utter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he could answer her, Arthur had to turn
his head away, and fix his eyes on the dancing fire-light.
Passing through the world’s long picture
gallery, it is oftentimes not the great paintings, not
the court ceremonials, not the huge sea pieces, not
the representations of battle-fields, not the important
portraits and the historical incidents which are
photographed on our memories, which are stamped
on our mental retina so indelibly, that through the
years they are never forgotten. It is not the large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>finished pictures which we went out to see, which we
took, perhaps, much notice of at the time, that stay
with us and remain in our memories longest; rather
it is the figure of some beggar child, the little
glimpse of woodland scenery, the barren bleakness
of some desolate moor, the hopeless languor of
a dying man’s hand,—these are the trifles which,
God knows why, we carry away with us. The
scenes of great account at which we have been
present, on which we have gazed, in which, perchance,
we have been actors, pale and fade away
from the canvas of our brains; but so long as
memory remains, there are slight gestures and
passing expressions which recur to us again and
again, and which will recur, till life leave us and
the mould be heaped up over the spot where we lie.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tone of a voice, the look in a face, the pressure
of a hand, a chance word spoken in love or in
anger, a stray sentence in a book—these things stay
with us when, to our thinking, weightier matters
are forgotten, when the passions and the sorrows,
the struggles and the successes of the years departed
have come to be in our recollections but as a flower
which has bloomed—a leaf which has faded.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Many a time in the after-days, when all the important
events and exciting interviews of that period
of his life had become blurred and indistinct, there
would rise up before Arthur Dudley’s mental sight
a vision of a woman kneeling beside him in the
fire-light, of a soft, tender voice entreating him to tell
her all—of white hands clasped tightly, in mute
supplication—of eyes uplifted, pleading for a fuller
confidence, for more perfect faith and love.</p>

<p class='c011'>Did he give her any one of the things she thus
silently asked for? Ah! it is hard for a man
who has started on a wrong road to retrace his
steps; it is well-nigh impossible for any one who
has been led on, and on, from less to more, from
little to much, to go back to the beginning, and
explain circumstantially how he has gradually become
entangled, deeper and deeper; how, meaning
to put forth for only a short sail, he has drifted
away to lands he never intended visiting—to shores
where he encountered strange people and formed
undesirable acquaintances, destined to change the
whole course of his life, to make a difference in his
career here, and, it may be—who can tell?—in his
state hereafter.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>So he was not frank, and the chance of a full and
free understanding between the husband and wife
ebbed back among the waves, to be restored by them
no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told her precisely what he had determined to
tell: he said he had been offered the secretaryship;
that he considered it too good a proposal to
refuse, and so he closed with it at once. He was
eloquent concerning the relief such a salary must
bring; he described all the advantages a residence in
town would ensure; was fluent about the house in
Lincoln’s Inn Fields—the wide staircase, the lofty
rooms, the airy situation, the pleasant gardens of
the Square; and then he wound up by saying, that
the only drawback to his perfect happiness and contentment
in the matter, was his fear lest Heather
should object to living in town—lest, being so much
attached to Berrie Down, she should dislike leaving
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he said this he took courage and turned and
looked at her, and, behold! the sad, lonely expression
was gone, and another, more difficult, perhaps,
to analyze, had come in its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Arthur,” she answered, and the low, sweet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>voice—in which, as I wrote once before, there was
a great virtue of leisure—was broken neither by
sorrow nor passion, as she spoke, “I love Berrie
Down much, but I love you better; I had not seen
this place when I married you. You need not be
afraid of it parting us now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And that was all! The dreaded confession was
made, and this was how she took it. Could anything
have been quieter, calmer, more satisfactory?
Yes; if she had been vexed and angry,
Arthur could have understood her better. If
she had cross-questioned him, and uttered reproaches
about his not having previously made a
confidante of her, he would have escaped that sense
of something being amiss which fell like ice upon
his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>He could not know what a world of feeling was
contained in the short sentence she had uttered.
How should he know? this man who never took his
wife in his arms, when she said she loved him better
than Berrie Down; nor told how she was more to
him than houses and lands—than gold and silver;
who allowed her to rise from the ground and stand
looking steadfastly into the fire, and only marvelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>what she could be thinking of—where on earth her
mind was wandering.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already that scene was for both of them a thing
of the past; already the lichens and the mosses of
memory were growing around, and taking the fresh
bareness off it, destroying the harshness of the cold,
grey outline.</p>

<p class='c011'>But half an hour before, and the news had still to
be imparted; and now the tidings were told and
received, and all difficulty was over; all doubt of
her concurrence removed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down the gallery of Time already the footsteps of
the past were echoing, carrying away that scene
from memory, in order to fling it into the lumberroom
containing life’s unused opportunities.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had been with him but a moment before to be
employed as a shield and a buckler, as a safeguard
from trouble, as a sword against the enemy; and,
behold, the man was so blind, so feeble, so incompetent,
as to let it slip from his fingers, and glide
away to be seized and borne off, and recalled no
more, save in sorrowful memories with unavailing
regrets.</p>

<p class='c011'>For when return to the land is impossible, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the most reckless will perceive the extent of the
danger he has courted, and stretch forth his hands
despairingly towards that fair shore which is receding
from his gaze for ever.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='c009'>LEAVING BERRIE DOWN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The programme of domestic arrangements which
Arthur Dudley had so ingeniously sketched out, as
he travelled from London to Palinsbridge, was, like
many other programmes, destined to undergo much
revision before being presented to the public.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, Mrs. Piggott’s prudence, or possibly,
even her morality, objected to being left alone
with Ned at Berrie Down in charge of that establishment.
A house without a mistress had always
been Mrs. Piggott’s special abhorrence,—a house
where things, as she said, “ran wild.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, Mrs. Dudley most earnestly desired that
if her lot were to be cast in town, it should not be
cast there in company with strange servants; and,
after much anxious discussion, it was accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>agreed that Susan should take Mrs. Piggott’s position,
and a new housemaid be engaged to fill Jane’s
place, while Prissy and Jane and Mrs. Piggott accompanied
the family to London. As an almost necessary
consequence of this arrangement, it was decided that
Agnes and Laura should remain at the Hollow;
Agnes willingly undertaking to “see to things” as
much as possible, and write Heather an account of
the farm proceedings every week.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ned, of course, was to take charge of out-door
matters, as hitherto; and Lucy and Cuthbert were
to proceed to town.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed to Mr. Black, when he heard these
various decisions, that the whole family must suddenly
have taken leave of their senses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why the deuce you could not have put in a
care-taker, and sold the cows, and got rid of all the
poultry, and let that Ned fellow see to the ploughing
and sowing, passes my comprehension. The girls
will never get married down there; why, I don’t
suppose they see a man from one year’s end to
another!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is one of them coming up, remember,”
said Arthur Dudley, in a tone of apology, as though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>some excuse were necessary for not putting his
sisters in the way of matrimonial chances; “and
Heather and they settled it, somehow, amongst
them. It appeared to me rather a good arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it may be, if you wish to have them on
your hands for ever,” answered Mr. Black; at
which remark Arthur bit his lip.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not like being interfered with, or advised
overmuch. If he wished his sisters to stay at Berrie
Down, what business was it of Mr. Black’s whether
they remained there or not? He had maintained
them when no other member of the family could or
would have done so, and he did not see that any
person had a right to make comments on what he
did or left undone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You need not look crusty, Squire,” proceeded
Mr. Black; “what I said is merely my opinion, and
you may take it for what it is worth; only I consider
it to be a confoundedly bad plan to have two
establishments, and so I tell you. I would shut up
Berrie Down, and move the whole party, bag and
baggage, to town. That is what I should do; but,
of course, you can do as you like.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Yes; and that is what I intend to do: much
obliged, at the same time, for your kind permission.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hoity-toity!” said Mr. Black, taking off his
hat, and bowing low as he spoke;—it was in one of
the empty rooms of Arthur’s house in Lincoln’s Inn
Fields that this conversation occurred,—“hoity-toity!
your most obedient, sir, and humbly beg
pardon for the liberty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a pet, Arthur turned away, and walking to one
of the windows, looked out over the Square, while
Mr. Black regarded him with a smile, in which there
lurked not merely amusement, but also triumph and
contempt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re a nice chicken, you are,” thus ran the
promoter’s secret thought; “and you have a sweet
temper, Mister Squire Dudley; and you think you
are able to manage your affairs, though anybody,
willing to take the trouble, might put a ring through
your nose, and lead you from here to Jericho. And
so you intend to do as you like! It will be as I like
before we have done with one another, I fancy; a
conceited, upsetting ass!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mr. Black was much too wise a man to allow
even a word of all this to pass his lips. He had his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>game still to play; and he would not mar the
chances of success by any irritated or indiscreet
remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, Dudley,” he said, “we are not going to
quarrel over trifles, are we? I meant no offence,
and am sorry if you have taken any. I have
knocked about the world too much to be as mealy-mouthed
as most of your acquaintances, but I should
be as sorry to vex you, perhaps, as any of them. I
am glad you like the papers I have chosen; you
will find everything in apple-pie order when you
bring up Mrs. Dudley and the children. So your
wife is going to try moving Miss Lally? I am glad
of it; I believe she will get well in half the time in
town.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was what Heather trusted also; she hoped
that some of the great doctors in London would be
able to do more for her little girl in a month than
the general practitioner at Fifield had effected in
five. Every one told her she was doing the wisest
thing possible in taking Lally to town! every one
was so kind and good!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Poole Seymour sent her carriage to convey
mother and child to the station, and Mr. Plimpton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>was at Palinsbridge, ready to conduct Lally across
the bridge, and deposit her safely in the compartment
he had secured for the travellers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Baldwin promised to call upon the girls
“very often,” and said she should not “forget to
find her way to Lincoln’s Inn when in town;” while
Mrs. Raidsford came lumbering over in the great
family chariot, and, not to be outdone in neighbourly
thoughtfulness and delicate consideration, brought
Heather a basket of the worst grapes growing in
the Moorlands conservatory, and offered to lend her
“one of the footmen,” if he could be of any service
in seeing to her luggage.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was fortunate for Heather she had, towards the
last, so many people to see, so many things to occupy
and distract her mind, or else that parting from
Berrie Down, when the spring flowers were budding,
when the fresh leaves were clothing all the trees,
when the birds were singing on every branch and
bough, must almost have broken her heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>She loved the spring-time—that time which always
seems more full of hope, and joy, and life, and promise
than any other period in the year. It had
been her delight, ever since she came to Berrie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Down, to watch the buds gradually forming, to peep
with the children at the nests, where eggs, speckled,
and blue, and white, and green, were covered by
birds that rarely took fright at sight, of the familiar
faces; to her, the lambing season was the pleasantest
of the four—the long, long summer stretched away
beyond the spring, and the rich, glowing autumn
beyond that, and all these good things were to be
had and enjoyed before the winter, with its leafless
trees, with its snows and frosts, with its rain and
storms, came again to Berrie Down.</p>

<p class='c011'>To any person passionately fond of the country, of
its sights, and sounds, and pleasures, the coming of
spring is as the beginning of a feast, as the sunrise
on the morning of a bright glad holiday. To Heather,
this had always been the happiest, most delicious
time at Berrie Down—these months when the lambs
commenced to dot the fields, when the daisies perked
up their faces among the green grass, when the hyacinths
began to bud in the dells, when the “sunny
celandine” opened on the hedge-bank, when the children
gathered branches of the crab-apple, when the
first broods of chickens chipped their shells and
went chirruping and scratching about the warmest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>corners of the farm-yard—when the sun really had
some power, when the fruit-trees were in blossom
and the lilacs showed for flower, when the tiger-lily
reared its head in the garden, when every
hedge-row was clad in its fresh robe of green, and
there was that nameless scent of spring pervading
that air—that scent with which the summer odours
vainly strive to compete.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a new sense of happiness upon her, with a
sensuous delight in the soft balmy air, in the fragrance
which pervaded the atmosphere, in the sunny
smile which shone on the face of Nature, in the
sudden stir which there seemed on every bough, in
every blade of grass—Heather, I say, when all the
things I have mentioned came to pass, would stand at
the open window of the drawing-room, looking down
over the Hollow, and away to the woods surrounding
Kemms’ Park, repeating to herself the while—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The winter is past—the rain is over and gone—the
flowers appear on the earth—the time for the
singing-birds is come—and the voice of the turtle
is heard in the land.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And now this time was come, and she had to
leave it behind.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Just when the hawthorn-buds were forming—when
the chestnut-trees were clothing themselves in
great masses of foliage, to be relieved presently and
lighted up with cone after cone of pure white flowers—when
the laburnums were about loosening their
golden curls, and the lilacs bethought themselves of
filling the air with a delicious fragrance—when the
westeria was hanging out its purple clusters, and the
pyracanthas at the gate were a perfect sheet of
bloom—when the white anemone and the starry
stitchwort dotted the woods—when everything
was looking its loveliest, and brightest, and purest,
Heather was compelled to leave the place her heart
had grown to during the years of her married life.</p>

<p class='c011'>For some time previously, Arthur had been resident
in town; but Mrs. Dudley, having many preparations
to make, many arrangements to complete,
remained at Berrie Down, not merely until the spring
blossoms were come, but also until Lally was sufficiently
recovered to travel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child still kept weakly and delicate; her once
tireless, limbs now refused to carry her for any long
period. If she started to run along one of the
garden walks, she soon returned to her mother with,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“Carry me, pease—legs ache.” The colour did
not return to her cheeks, nor strength to her body,
neither did she get plump and soft again, as Heather
hoped would have been the case.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poor wasted arms, and little white face, and
thin slight figure, had a pleading pitifulness about
them, which the child’s eager desire for exercise,
her unquenched vivacity, made more pathetic still.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whatever Lally saw any other creature doing,
that she desired to essay also. She wanted to run
after the lambs, and scamper like the dogs, and be
out over the fields with Cuthbert, and trotting behind
Agnes and Mrs. Piggott, to dairy, and poultry-yard,
and paddock; but it was not to be! The
spirit was there—strong, restless, excitable as ever;
but the body was changed. No more gallops for
Lally on any one’s shoulder—no more charming
excursions in Ned’s wheelbarrow—no more clambering
up ladders, and lofty thrones on the top of haystacks
and corn-ricks—no more playing at hide-and-seek
in the hollow—no more running after the ducks,
and shrill laughter at seeing them take to the water
in order to escape the pursuit of their tiny persecutor—no
more searchings after hens that had stolen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>away to lay—no more of these old happinesses for
Lally. Sickness had caught her one day, when his
advent was least looked for—caught and put her in
a cage, which would not permit her to move far in
any direction, against the bars of which the little restless
heart fluttered and beat only to its own hurt—a
cage from which no human hand could release her,
though loving friends were all around, and kindly
eyes, often with tears in them, regarded the impatient
child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tired—tired—always tired! Many and many a
time, when Heather, hearing this plaint, lifted her
child in her arms, she had to turn aside lest Lally
should see she was weeping; but one day Lally,
peeping round, beheld the tears on her mother’s
face, and said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Oo crying, ma?—is it about Lally? Big, fat
lady told Lally she’ll get some-sing when she goes
to London, that will make her better as well. When
are we going, ma—when?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And because her own hopes were identical with
Lally’s words, Mrs. Dudley did not grieve so much
concerning leaving Berrie Down as might otherwise
have been the case. As regarded the increase of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>income, the prospect of greater pecuniary comfort,
Heather felt no elation whatever.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Arthur were satisfied, she could easily make
herself satisfied also; but she had little faith that
anything in which Mr. Black figured as prime
mover would ultimately prove advantageous to her
husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, if a person have half a million a year, he
can but be happy; and Heather knew perfectly well
that the secret of being happy, even on two hundred
a year, is to be satisfied therewith.</p>

<p class='c011'>Arthur had never been contented, and she
was quite aware that the increase to his income
could not make him so. She understood her husband’s
peculiarities sufficiently by this time to know
that his wants would only grow with what they
fed on.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Mr. Black’s cry were always more capital,
Arthur’s had always been a larger revenue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Looking back over her married life with eyes
from which the glamour of early love was now completely
cleared away, Heather saw that money
matters might have been better with them for years
past, had Arthur only been energetic, and strong, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>determined, like other men—had he finished his
draining instead of leaving it half completed—had
he turned up his land and laid out money by
degrees, as he could spare it, on that which never
proves ungrateful for capital wisely expended, for
care judiciously bestowed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not be blind to the fact that, as a rule,
they had bought stock dear and sold it cheap—that
what Alick had often said, “Arthur is neither
master nor man: neither master to give orders and
see them carried out, nor man to obey orders if given
by anybody else,” was true.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no fairy mist hanging before her mental
vision now. Like Mr. Stewart, she feared the person
who could not make money at Berrie Down, plainly
and economically as they had lived for years, would
not be likely to make or to keep much money elsewhere.
Certainly the thousand a year was something
tangible—a peg on which to hang her faith, had any
faith been left; but, like most women who have
passed all the most important years of their lives in
the country, Heather entertained a perfect horror of
the expenses of living in town.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not believe one sentence of what Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Black said about an income going as far there as in
the country. She knew, no one better, how very
small a money outlay had sufficed to maintain the
family at Berrie Down comfortably and respectably.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those only who have eaten of the fat of their own
lands, and beheld the wheat growing which is afterwards
to be ground into flour—who have scarcely
missed from amongst the rough abundance of all
farm produce, the poultry and milk, the butter,
eggs, hams, vegetables, and meat necessary for the
consumption even of a large family—can tell what a
very difficult thing it is to cater for an establishment
in town, where everything, to the country imagination,
seems sold according to its weight in gold—where
a housekeeper’s hand is never out of her
pocket from one week’s end to another—where it is
either bills or cash, but, in any case, ultimately
money—where even a few sprigs of parsley, even a
bunch of savoury herbs, cannot be procured without
purchase, without going through the ceremony of
buying that which, at the old home, grew wild,
almost, along the sunniest borders—wild, to be had
for the mere trouble of gathering.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of that mongrel country life which exists in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>suburbs of great towns, and which has given rise to
various sayings concerning home-laid eggs at a
shilling a-piece, carrots at half-a-guinea the bunch,
butter half-a-crown a pound, and milk eighteen-pence
a quart, Heather had no experience. She
only knew that her father’s glebe lands and Arthur’s
farm had enabled their respective families to make
both ends meet, without pinching in the parlour, or
an over-strict and painful economy in the kitchen;
and she dreaded entering on what was to her an
utterly untried career—that of managing a town
establishment, and entering every item, from cream
to laundry work, in her formerly easily-kept housekeeping
book.</p>

<p class='c011'>All these matters she had discussed, after a
woman’s diffuse fashion, with Agnes and Mrs.
Piggott; and Agnes and Mrs. Piggott had both
agreed that much might still be forwarded from
Berrie Down; that it would only be Ned’s time and
the pony’s to run over to Palinsbridge with a weekly
hamper for town; “and besides, you will be often
down yourself, I hope, Heather,” added Agnes; but
Heather shook her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The expense,” she said, “will be more than I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>should like to incur frequently. I am afraid,
although a thousand a year sounds a great deal,
it will not go very far in London, more especially in
the style Arthur talks of living.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But his shares, you know, Heather?” suggested
Agnes, hopefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I had forgotten them,” was the reply,
evidently intended to be affirmative of the girl’s
cheerful views, but failing of its purpose, because
Mrs. Dudley’s tone implied that, now she did remember
the shares, her spirits were not unduly raised.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had heard too many revelations from Mrs.
Black to be mightily exalted at the idea of being
even indirectly connected with a company. That
lady had favoured her with too many descriptions of
how they had “up and down,” “seeing and sawing,”
for Mrs. Dudley’s heart to flutter at the prospect of
wealth suddenly spread out before them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it was here to-day, it was gone to-morrow,”
Mrs. Black had sadly lamented; “and, while it was
here, we had nothing but anxiety; and when it was
there, we had a trouble to keep the wolf from the
door. I am sure, my dear, what I have gone through
would make a history.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Heather Dudley not having the slightest desire to
go through experiences sufficiently varied and unpleasant
to justify any one compiling a history concerning
her, would, had the choice been offered, decidedly
have preferred remaining where there was no chance
of such ups and downs as Mrs. Black mentioned
occurring in her life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The choice, however, not being offered, she had
at last no alternative left but to bid adieu to Berrie
Down; and, accompanied by Miss Hope, who kindly
came up from Tunbridge Wells to “see the last”
of her old favourite drive over to Palinsbridge,
whence she travelled by one of the afternoon trains
to London.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you how it would be,” said that Job’s
comforter, Alithea Hope, spinster, as she and Mrs.
Dudley drove along the pleasant country roads to
the station—Heather crouched up into one corner of
Mrs. Seymour’s carriage, so that her child might lie
on the seat with her head resting on her mother’s lap—“I
told you how it would be, if you refused to take
my advice; and now I hope you are satisfied at the
result of your non-interference principle. Sweetness,
and amiability, and submission, and all that kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>thing, are delightful traits, no doubt, in a wife, but
they are qualities thrown away on Arthur Dudley—and
so you will find out some day. The kindest
thing you could have done to your husband would
have been to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Now, look here, Arthur: if you are resolved to
make a fool of yourself, I won’t make a fool of
myself with you. Go to town if you like, but I stay
at Berrie Down. If you are determined to take the
bread out of your children’s mouths, I am equally
resolved we shall not all be left paupers, if I can
prevent it; therefore, I mean to remain and manage
the farm, and whenever you are tired of your shares
and your companies, and your Blacks and your
town life, you can come home again.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather laughed; she was a little hysterical about
leaving Berrie Down and all the kind friends she
had recently found there, and so even while she
laughed the tears came into her eyes again.</p>

<p class='c011'>The idea of her making such a speech to Arthur;
of her taking such a stand and setting her will up
in open defiance of his; of her twitting her husband
with his decision, and prophesying failure for him!
Heather could not choose but laugh, and then she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>cried; and then Miss Hope told her she was a soft,
silly, stupid creature, who had no more business to
marry Arthur Dudley than Mr. Raidsford had to
marry that great vulgar illiterate dowdy, who “came
over in her caravan to see you this morning; you
don’t want me to speak about Mrs. Raidsford before
Lally,—is that the meaning of all those signs? The
sooner Lally is taught to repeat nothing she hears,
the better; the sooner little girls learn their mouths
and ears were given them to be kept tight shut, the
more sugar-plums will be bought and popped in
between their little red lips. Are you attending to
me, Lally?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Iss; but how’s me to eat sugar-plums if I keeps
mows shut?” inquired Miss Hope’s pupil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are to open it at proper times,” answered
her teacher; “but not to repeat what older people
say before you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lally don’t ’peat,” replied the child, wearily.
“Ma, is it far to London now? will it be long
before we are there? me so tired—me so tired!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whereupon mother and aunt looked at each
other, and Miss Hope said,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will send for a doctor soon, Heather; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>do try that delightful man I was speaking to you
about. His manner with children is quite charming:
wins their little hearts, and makes them feel at
home with him directly. I am sure, when I went to
him with Mrs. Walter Hope about her Charlie’s
legs, if he had been the boy’s father he could not
have taken more interest in his case; said he must
see him at least once a week, for six months; took
the child on his knee, and made himself so pleasant.
There was only one stupid remark he made, which
surprised me in so clever a man, namely, that he
could tell in a moment whose child Charlie was, his
likeness to his mother being remarkable. I longed
to ask him where his eyes were, for the boy is a
Hope, every inch of him, and very like me,—even
his own father admits that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather laughed again; she was evidently in a
laughing mood, for the slightest thing provoked her
merriment. Perhaps it was a comfort to this “silly
goose” to discover that even Miss Hope had her
weak points, and could be touched through them
like her neighbours; perhaps the description of
Charlie’s model doctor tickled her fancy; any way
she laughed; and Lally, putting up her little hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>patted her mother’s cheek, and smiled a weak, faint
smile in sympathy, while she asked,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ma, was that ’tild as ill as me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I wonder,” broke out Miss Hope, “if it
be a consequence of ‘original sin’ that children
always speak bad grammar. Is it the depravity of
our human nature which always confounds the parts of
speech, and makes a jumble of the personal pronouns?
She never heard bad grammar spoken by
any one belonging to her, and only listen to her
English; if you can call such a language as she
speaks English. You want to know if Charlie was as
ill as ‘me,’” added the spinster, directly addressing
Lally; “yes; and a great deal-worse; his legs
were like a bow, bent out like that;” and Miss
Hope would have practically demonstrated what
Charlie’s legs were like on Lally’s person, but
that the child resisted any such experiments being
attempted with her limbs. “Positively, Heather,
you never saw such a sight as the child was,” she
continued; “but Doctor Chickton assured Fanny
he could make a perfect cure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will he cure me?” asked Lally, egotistical as
most sick people are. Months of undivided maternal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>solicitude, the devotion of a whole household, the
visits of ladies vieing one with another who should
bring Lally most toys and dainties, had spoiled the
child a little, perhaps; or it may be that long illness
and a close and undivided consideration of her own
ailments, had produced a certain self-consciousness
and absorption. In either case, there can be no
question but that Lally was exceedingly sorry for
herself, that she felt her case to be a very hard one;
and that she was precisely in that state of mind and
body which might well tire out any love except a
mother’s, any patience save that which seems well-nigh
inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the previous day Leonard and Lucy, and
Cuthbert, together with Mrs. Piggott and Priscilla
Dobbin, had journeyed to town, and now Heather
and her first-born were bringing up the rear of the
Dudley domestic army. It was a great point that
Heather should have nothing to attend to excepting
Lally, that she should not be troubled with luggage
or parcels, or anything besides the sick child; and all
the others being gone before, was a relief to her, so
as to obviate the necessity for conversation or movement,
or stir or sound, likely to disturb the little girl.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Mr. Plimpton, one of the most good-natured men
who ever existed, saw Mrs. Dudley into her compartment,
and impressed the guard with the importance
of permitting no other passengers to intrude
into it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The child is very ill indeed,” he explained;
which explanation he perhaps made clearer by
slipping half-a-crown into the man’s hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I declare, if it were not that Lady Emily might
wonder what had become of me, I would run up to
town with you myself, Mrs. Dudley, and see you
safe; but I think the guard will take care that no
other passengers get in. Good-bye—good-bye,
Miss Lally; don’t quite forget me, though you are
going to live in London. Have you any message
for my wife? she will be certain to inquire whether
you sent her one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lally’s love give her,” said the child, who was
now all excitement at the bustle, and the noise, and
the steam, and the number of the people, and the
general variety,—“Lally’s love—and a tiss;” and
she kissed the tall gentleman, spite of his bushy
whiskers and bristling moustache, both articles which
ordinarily tried her equanimity and temper not a
little.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“That child will never be better,” was Mr.
Plimpton’s summary of Lally’s state on his return
home. “They may take her where they like, and
send for whom they like, but she will never be strong
again. Poor Mrs. Dudley believes it to be a question
of treatment, but I am confident no treatment will
ever put the little creature to rights.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Miss Hope, she drove back to Berrie Down
“crying like an idiot,” so she informed Agnes all
the way. “Dear me, I wish people would not have
children,” she said; “that Lally is enough to break
a person’s heart. Why cannot she get strong as
any other child would? I declare I am out of
patience with her, month after month, and like a bag
of bones at the end. And of all things on earth she
must set up a lamentation for that Bessie, whom she
ought to have forgotten long ago; asking her
mother if they should see her in London, and
whether she would not be with them always, and
sing to her at night. As if Heather were not
vexed enough and sad enough without that;” and
Miss Hope tossed aside her bonnet, which Laura
carried upstairs, for the spinster was going to stay
with the girls for a time, to see how they went on
and managed by themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Then came a millennium of “Christian cookery,”
and of “coffee fit to be swallowed;” then Miss Hope
was in her element,—a mistress over two young
mistresses, who obeyed her implicitly, and allowed
her to order Susan about as much as she pleased.</p>

<p class='c011'>But having one’s own way is not always conducive
to perfect happiness; being monarch of all one’s
surveys does not invariably produce perfect contentment.
Even a contest with Mrs. Piggott would occasionally
have served to break the monotony of being
able to do as she pleased, which Miss Hope at length
felt to be insupportable; and every day, and a score
of times during the course of every day, she repeated
that Berrie Down was not Berrie Down without
Heather, who, the guard proving faithful to the
trust reposed in him, travelled alone to London with
Lally, and was met at King’s Cross by Alick and
Lucy, the former of whom could only say, “Well,
mother, this is a happy change for me,” as he helped
her out of the carriage, and walked beside her
along the platform, carrying Lally in his arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no loneliness about that arrival in the
great Babylon, even although Arthur could not meet
his wife;—for the strong hands which had smoothed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>her way, and helped her through many a difficulty
at Berrie Down, were stretched forth now to guide
and guard her through the midst of the human
wilderness whither she had come.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c009'>NOT QUITE SATISFIED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Time went by once more; not as it had done at
Berrie Down, smoothly as a calm river gliding noiselessly
to the sea, but swiftly and excitedly, splashing
among the stones, dashing between rocks, rushing
over slight obstacles, eddying round larger impediments,
rapid as a mountain stream speeding to the
valley, with as great a roar and hurry and excitement
as that wherewith water falls from a vast
height into the basin it has through the centuries
worn for itself below. Thus time sped by in
London, so rapidly, so like an arrow cleaving the
air, that often Heather’s breath was almost taken
from her by the swiftness and impetuosity of its
passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet the change was not wholly or even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>partially unpleasant. There is a great adaptability
about some natures which makes the work of transplantation
easy and pleasant to accomplish. Their
roots are not ungrateful; move them where you will
almost, they contrive to extract nourishment from
the soil, and put forth their leaves, and their flowers,
and their fruits, in the city, as in the field; in the
midst of bricks and mortar, as away in the far
country where the air is pure and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c011'>They take good out of all things, whence good is
possible to be extracted; they are willing to sing
songs in a strange land, and will take down their
harps and tune them in whatsoever household their
lot is cast. The man or woman who enjoys one
pleasure keenly is not likely to be insensible to
another; and therefore, although Heather’s first love
was her last, still she made herself very contented in
London—was amused with the excitement and the
variety that surrounded her; went to concerts and
theatres with all the pleasure a young girl might
have evinced, and conducted herself, on the whole,
not merely to the satisfaction of her husband, but
also to that of Mr. Black.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who was now a power not to be despised, a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>worth ever so much money, and likely to be worth
ever so much more, a man engaged in floating fresh
companies, and successful in obtaining grants and
concessions, and first refusals, and early information
to an extent which it would be quite outside the
province of this story to explain more fully.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had bought a splendid house out at Ealing,
and was fitting it up regardless of expense. In
Stanley Crescent he gave the most wonderful parties
that it had ever entered into Mrs. Dudley’s imagination
to conceive could be given by any one not possessed
of a ducal revenue. She had thought the
furniture in Lincoln’s Inn Fields far and away more
expensive than any Mr. Black should have persuaded
Arthur into purchasing, but the promoter
assured her it was “all right; upon his sacred word
of honour, it had not cost a sixpence more than
Dudley was perfectly justified in spending.” And
when she beheld Adamant House, as Mr. Black’s
new house at Ealing was happily called, she thought
if one of the chiefs of the Company could afford such
magnificence, their own, by comparison modest
establishment, could not be considered “over-timbered,”
to quote from the promoter’s vocabulary over
again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>From room to room she walked, dazzled and
bewildered, and Mr. Black walked beside, enjoying
her astonishment, and kindly acting as cicerone to
her inexperienced country understanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, is not this better than grubbing on?” he
triumphantly inquired, when, seated in his carriage,
they were driving back to Lincoln’s Inn. “This
is what a man can do who is not afraid, who feels
his own strength, and is sure of being able to keep
his feet under him. Ay, and by Jove, Dudley shall do
as well yet as I have done! He deserves to do well,
and so do you, Mrs. Dudley; for a more sensible
woman, and one less under the dominion of prejudice,
I never met. Many a wife would have striven
to keep Dudley back—to dissuade him from coming
to London, but you were too wise to attempt such
interference, and therefore I say you deserve to
succeed, and to have every bit as fine a carriage as
this to bowl about in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Which termination struck Heather as being so
intensely ludicrous that she laughed outright, laughed
even while she thought gravely enough that, had
her interference been likely to produce the slightest
good result, she would never have refrained from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>attempting it. This little explanation, however,
being quite unnecessary to offer to Mr. Black, she
took his compliment as though she deserved it
every word, and laughed while the promoter thought,
in his own elegant language, “that he had got to
the blind side of Mrs. Dudley also, and would be
shortly able to wind her round his finger as he had
done the Squire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In those early days, Arthur Dudley certainly
proved himself to be as foolish and confiding a
gentleman as any rogue need have desired to meet
with.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although he saw the grand house at Ealing,
although every morning Mr. Black, <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> to the
City, thundered up to the door of the Protector
Company’s offices in his carriage and pair, and
swaggered and blustered about the place as though
the clerks, and the secretary, and the cashier, and
the whole concern, in fact, were his own personal
and exclusive property, still Arthur never insisted
on a settlement of their accounts, never objected to
renew bills, never made any difficulty about accepting
new ones. He believed implicitly every sentence
Mr. Black told him, and had much greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>faith in the promoter’s genius than in that of his
own especial principal, Mr. Stewart, who, having
put in a secretary and cashier of his own choosing,
now rarely came near the office excepting on special
board days, and when he paid formal visits to
Mrs. Dudley, who always received him with the uncomfortable
feeling, that if he knew who she really
was, his calls would be fewer and shorter still.</p>

<p class='c011'>But at length there came a certain coolness
between the promoter and the secretary, which
commenced in this wise:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I tell you what it is, Dudley,” said Mr.
Black, one day when, for the third time, his kinsman’s
renewals had been required and effected; “I
tell you what it is,—this paper of yours has been
through the fire often enough, it will never do to
run it on till it gets scorched. You don’t know
what I mean, I see, but it is just this: a girl may
walk out with a man once, and people think nothing
about it—they may have met by accident, no consequence—but
if she goes on walking, talk begins,
there is some game up. Now, a man’s credit
is much in the same position. He may renew
once or twice, and nobody thinks anything strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>of his doing so; if he continue renewing, however,
his name gets blown upon, and banks begin—especially
if he be in no business—to look askance
on his paper. That is your position at the present
time; you must not ask for more discount,
or, at least, if you do, you will not get it. I
have done my best for you this time, and so has
Crossenham, but I am greatly afraid we shall not
be able to get you passed again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I suppose you will take up the bills next
time?” suggested Arthur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no objection to taking up those that I
have had value for,” answered Mr. Black, a little
astonished, perhaps, at Arthur’s so speedily discovering
the weak point in his armour; “but what
are you to do with yours? That is the important
part of the business, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know,” Arthur replied; “I should
have supposed one part of it to be about as important
as the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you would have supposed wrong, then,”
retorted Mr. Black; “because, though I am deucedly
short, and shall be short for the next twelvemonth,
still I could make a pinch of meeting my bills;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>but how you are to take up yours, until the shares
become marketable, I confess puzzles me to imagine—unless,
indeed, you decide to raise a few thousands
on Berrie Down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A few thousands!” repeated Arthur, in amazement,
“a few thousands! Why, my bills altogether
cannot amount to more than a few hundreds!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t they, by Jove!” said Mr. Black, coolly.
“Just run your eye over that little list—there is
not sixpence of mine among it,—and you will soon
change your opinion. You have had a lot of money,
one time and another. Then you bought this place;
then there is the discount.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought you were going to pay that?” Arthur
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On those which were drawn for my accommodation,
of course,” replied Mr. Black. “I am now
talking of yours. Then there was the doing up of
this house——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You told me the Company would put it in
proper order for me to live in,” once again interposed
Mr. Dudley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So they would, had it been for any other person
excepting the owner of the house,” answered Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Black. “I had, as I told you, to waive that point.
I wrote you all about it after you were up at the
beginning of the year.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, you are mistaken,” said Arthur; “you
never wrote a syllable to me on the subject!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All I can say is, then, that I either wrote or
intended to write,” answered Mr. Black; “but I
had such a deuce of a lot of things to attend to
about that time, your letter may have slipped my
memory. However, that’s nothing to do with what
we are talking of now. If you will consider the
affair, it was absurd to expect the Company both to
pay you rent and to paint and paper your house.
They could not do it. I forgot about its being your
own property—about your, in fact, being landlord
and our being tenants, till you were back at Berrie
Down. We pay you a very good rent, so you must
not be dissatisfied. Then, you see, there is the
furniture.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good Heavens!” exclaimed Arthur, “you never
mean to say that the furniture we have in this house
cost twelve hundred and seventy-eight pounds?
Where could twelve hundred and seventy-eight
pounds worth be put?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“My dear fellow, how you talk!” said Mr. Black,
with a smile of infinite superiority, “why, you might
put double the money up in a corner and scarcely
see it! Most economical I call the whole arrangement.
You have a drawing-room fit to ask anybody
into, a grand trichord thingamajig of Erard’s,
good solid chairs and tables, every room fully carpeted,
dinner and dessert services complete, glasses
large enough for Buckingham Palace, bedchambers
that you need not mind putting a duke to sleep in—all
for twelve hundred odd pounds!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But that is more than a year’s income,” Arthur
persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon—taking rent and everything,
it is not nearly a year’s income; but, even if it were,
the man who can rig a house up like this for a twelve
months pay, is a very fortunate fellow. I told you,
I would not run you to a farthing’s unnecessary
expense, and neither I did. In your position here,
in London, it would not do for you to have the same
old-fashioned curiosities that served your purpose
very well at Berrie Down; besides, the money is
not lost, there is the furniture—well kept, it would
fetch its cost any day by auction; now tot up those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>items, and let us see the sum total. Yes; that is
just what I made it, running through the account
roughly—four thousand six hundred and eleven
pounds, seventeen shillings and nine pence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Black! I never had that sum of money,”
said Arthur, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you had not money, you had goods,” answered
Mr. Black; “but you have had a smartish sum of
money too. The pace you have gone at the last
twelvemonth has not been a slow one. Those
dinners you gave—and the money you spent in
town——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you said the Company would pay all that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So it has; you have your shares and your
salary, and your good rent for these premises. I
never meant direct payment. The idea is absurd.
How would an entry like this sound:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Dinner at the Wellington, to six desirable
City men,’ or ‘Treating Cadger’s managing clerk to
the theatre, with supper after,’ or ‘Stall tickets to
the Misses Smithers,’ or ‘Half a sov. to Jenkins’
footman!’ Just bring the thing home, Dudley;
think how ridiculous it would sound, and don’t be
unreasonable. You have had your penn’orths, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>you will have more—besides, it really is this house
and furniture, neither of which is likely to run
away, that has walked into the money. Think over
the matter, will you? any time during the course of
the next two months, and let me know what you
decide;” and with that, the promoter was airily
taking himself out of the room, when “Black!”
sharply spoken by his companion, arrested his
departure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never had this money,” Mr. Dudley repeated.
“I never could have had it; where has it gone—what
has been done with it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for that, Dudley,” was the reply—“take my
advice, and never waste your time inquiring after
spent money. Enough for you, or any man, to
know that it has gone—to the tomb of all those
people one hears about. No use trying to hold a
<em>post-mortem</em> examination on the body of a defunct
ten-pound note. For the rest, you both could and
did have all the sums I have debited you with; they
are regularly entered on their dates of payment in
my books. First day you are down in the City,
call in and check them off. I’d rather you would
do so—more satisfactory for us both.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>And with this Parthian shot, Mr. Black said
“Good-day,” and shut the office-door after him,
leaving Arthur far too much perplexed and bewildered
to consider that a lie can be written as well
as spoken, any day in the year, and that the mere
fact of an entry to his debit being made on such
and such a date, did not by any means of necessity
prove that such debt had ever been incurred.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
